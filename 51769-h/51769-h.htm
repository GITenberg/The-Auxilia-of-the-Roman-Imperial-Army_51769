<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following essay is an attempt to deal with an interesting branch
of Roman military history which has not previously been made the
subject of an independent treatise. In a study of this kind, which
relies largely upon epigraphical evidence to which additions are
constantly being made, it is equally necessary that the scattered
material available should at intervals be collected and utilized, and
that the unfortunate collector should realize that his conclusions
will inevitably be revised in the future in the light of fresh
evidence. I hope, accordingly, that I have made some use of all
sources of information available without acquiring or expressing
excessive confidence in the finality of my deductions. Students of
the military system of the Roman Empire may complain that a certain
number of complicated questions are too summarily disposed of in the
following pages, but if discussion of the evidence in detail has been
occasionally omitted with the idea of keeping the size of this book
within reasonable limits, I hope that I have been careful to indicate
where uncertainty lies.</p>

<p>I have in many places been glad to acknowledge my indebtedness to my
predecessors in this field of study, who in one branch of the subject
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> another have removed so many difficulties from my path. To two
scholars, however, my debt is too extensive and general to have
received adequate recognition in the footnotes. Mommsen’s article, ‘Die
Conscriptionsordnung der r&ouml;mischen Kaiserzeit,’ was written thirty
years ago; I have, I hope, been diligent in collecting the evidence
which has since accumulated, but I have found little to induce me to
leave the path indicated by the founder of the scientific study of the
Roman Empire. I owe much to Professor A. von Domaszewski’s ingenious
and comprehensive work, <cite>Die Rangordnung des r&ouml;mischen Heeres</cite>, and
feel my obligation to its learning and suggestiveness none the less
that I have sometimes been compelled to differ from the conclusions
stated in it. I am also deeply indebted to Professor Haverfield for
constant encouragement and much valuable criticism, and can only wish
that this essay were a more adequate testimony to the value of his
influence upon the study of Roman history at Oxford. I desire also
to express my gratitude to my colleague, Mr. N. Whatley, of Hertford
College, for reading this essay in manuscript, and making many valuable
suggestions.</p>

<span class="small">THE MILITARY REFORMS OF AUGUSTUS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> essay on the Roman auxilia might seem merely to be one of the many
monographs in which students of the military system of the Roman Empire
are patiently arranging material for some future scholar to utilize
in a more comprehensive work. But while much space must necessarily
be devoted to details of military organization, the subject opens up
social and political questions of wider range. The extent to which
a ruling race can safely use the military resources of its subjects
and the effect on both parties of such a relation, the advantages and
dangers of a defensive or an aggressive frontier policy, these are
questions of universal historical interest, on which even an essay of so
limited a scope as this must necessarily touch in passing.</p>

<p>As a preliminary consideration it must be realized that the use of
troops drawn from the subject races was not an invention of the
imperial government, but goes back to the most flourishing days
of the Republic. The heavy-armed yet mobile infantry which formed
the greater part of the burgess militia of the <em>cives Romani</em> and
the <em>socii</em> constituted an arm which won for Rome the hegemony of
Italy, and triumphed alike over the numbers and courage of Ligurian
and Gaul or the disciplined professional armies of Carthage and the
Hellenistic monarchies. In other branches of the service, however, the
republican armies were less superior. Their cavalry, drawn, as was
usual in the citizen armies of the ancient world, from the wealthier
classes, was not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> numerous and proved no match for its
opponents in the Second Punic War. The light troops came off even
worse when engaged either with mountain tribes fighting on their
own ground or with the skilled archers and slingers of Carthage or
Macedon. So early was this recognized that, in describing an offer
made by Hiero of Syracuse to furnish a thousand archers and slingers
in 217 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, Livy is able to make the Syracusans justify the
suggestion to Roman pride by asserting that it was already customary
for the Republic to use <em>externi</em> in this capacity.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> To make up
their notorious deficiency in this respect the Government could have
recourse to three sources of supply. They could, as in this case,
accept or demand contingents from allies outside the Italian military
league, such as Hiero, Masinissa, or the Aetolians; they could make
forced levies among subject tribes, such as the Ligurians, Gauls,
or Spaniards; or, finally, they could imitate their opponents and
raise mercenaries, although they might save their pride by including
such contingents as ‘allies’. In fact all these sources were freely
drawn on during the first half of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,
and all troops of this kind were known as <em>auxilia</em>, to distinguish
them from the <em>socii</em> of the old organization. This at any rate seems
to be the distinction recognized by the grammarians, and it agrees
generally with the terminology employed by Livy, who may be supposed
in such a matter to be following his sources.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> A good example both
of republican methods and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> phraseology employed may be found in
Livy’s elaborate description of the measures taken to make up the army
required for the Macedonian campaign of 171 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>: ‘P. Licinio
consuli ad exercitum civilem socialemque petenti addita auxilia Ligurum
duo milia, Cretenses sagittarii&mdash;incertus numerus, quantum rogati
auxilia Cretenses misissent, Numidae item equites elephantique.’<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Of
the troops grouped here under the heading of <em>auxilia</em> the Numidians
represent a contingent sent by an independent ally, Masinissa, the
Ligurians were probably obtained by a forced levy, while the Cretans,
nominally allies, may fairly be described as mercenaries. That their
services were hardly disinterested is shown by the fact that in the
following year the Senate found it necessary to issue a sharp warning
to the Cretan states against their habit of supplying contingents to
both sides.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The fact that the Roman star was now definitely in the
ascendant probably reconciled the Cretans to this interference with
their national customs, for from this date onward Cretan regiments
regularly form a part of the republican armies; it will be remembered
that the Senate made use of a body of Cretan archers against the
followers of Caius Gracchus, and a similar corps is found serving under
Caesar in his second Gallic campaign.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The course of the second century saw the auxilia still more firmly
established as an essential part of the republican military system.
Before its close the Roman and Italian cavalry had entirely
disappeared; the changes in the condition of military service, in
particular the tedious and unprofitable Spanish campaigns, made
the members of the upper classes, among whom the cavalry had been
recruited, increasingly reluctant to take their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> places in the ranks as
private soldiers. After the reforms of Marius the legion had no cavalry
attached to it, and if the Italian contingents still existed they must
likewise have disappeared when, in consequence of the extension of
the franchise in 90 and 89 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, the former <em>socii</em> were all
enrolled in the legions. From this moment the Roman generals depended
for their cavalry upon the auxilia alone.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> In the case of the
light-armed troops the same process took place, although here military
rather than political reasons probably predominated. The last recorded
use of the <em>velites</em>, the old national light infantry, is during the
war against Iugurtha, and they were probably abolished by Marius.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
There is certainly no instance of any but auxiliaries being employed as
light troops during the following century. From these considerations
it necessarily follows that when, during the last fifty years of the
Republic, a standing army came into existence, a number of auxiliary
regiments formed part of it. When Caesar mentions that he had Cretan
archers, Balearic slingers, and Numidian cavalry under his command so
early as the beginning of his second campaign, we can hardly doubt that
these regiments had formed part of the regular troops which he found in
the province.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Thus before the end of the Republic we have the chief feature of the
military system of the Empire, the division of the army into the
legions of <em>cives Romani</em> and the auxiliary light troops and cavalry
supplied by the unenfranchised provincials, already in existence. Even
the practice of conferring the <em>civitas</em> upon troops of this class as a
reward for military service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> was resorted to by the Republic, although
probably only under exceptional conditions. We possess a document
recording a grant of this nature to some Spanish auxiliaries, members
of a <em>turma Salluitana</em> which had distinguished itself at the siege of
Asculum in 89 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>There is no evidence, however, that this branch of the service
escaped the effects of the inefficiency in administration which
characterized the last generation of the republican r&eacute;gime. Certainly
too few regiments of this class were kept on a permanent footing,
and a general of the period either had to take the field with far
too small a proportion of cavalry and light infantry, or make up the
deficiency by hasty levies called out in the districts nearest to
the scene of operations. Caesar, for example, started the campaign
of 58 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> with a totally insufficient number of regular
auxiliaries, and during the following years was forced to make up his
deficiency in cavalry by demanding contingents, which were often of
more than doubtful fidelity, from the Gallic tribes which successively
submitted to his arms. To supplement these he also raised a corps of
German mercenaries and largely increased it later after the defection
of the majority of the Gallic contingents to Vercingetorix.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The civil wars saw a large increase in the numbers of the auxilia.
Caesar set the example by leading off thousands of his Gallic cavalry,
with the object, doubtless, of using them as hostages for their
compatriots’ fidelity as well as of increasing his army. Pompeius
followed suit and endeavoured to make up for the loss of the Italian
recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> ground by enrolling auxilia from the Eastern provinces
in large numbers. The Gallic cavalry proved a great success; in the
campaign of Thapsus they showed marked superiority to the African light
horse, previously accounted supreme in cavalry warfare,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and the
death of Caesar found them still serving in large numbers in every part
of the Empire. At least those who are found, together with Lusitanians
and Spaniards, in the army of Brutus and Cassius during the Philippi
campaign must have been stationed either in Macedonia or the East
before hostilities began.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>We can thus see that when the battle of Actium in 31 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>
placed the forces of the Roman world in the hands of Augustus, the main
lines on which the military system of the Empire was based were already
clearly marked, and his great work of reorganization, while importing
everywhere order and principle into existing practice, involved no
breach with the military traditions of the past. To say this is in no
sense to minimize his achievement. It must be remembered that while
individual generals, such as Lucullus, Pompeius, or Caesar, had brought
their armies to a high pitch of efficiency, the general military
administration of the late republic had been chaotic in the extreme.
Here, as elsewhere, the real issues were resolutely evaded, and in case
of need a crisis had to be met by hasty and inefficient improvisation.
Although a standing army had existed in practice for fifty years it
was never accepted in principle, and no attempt was made to assess the
military requirements of the state and see that an efficient force of
the proper strength was maintained. With similar lack of foresight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the Senate refused to admit the principle of granting a donative on
discharge, while repeatedly granting it under pressure, thus weakening
the control of the central government over troops in the field and
increasing the chances of a military <em>pronunciamento</em>. In consequence,
the wars of this period almost invariably begin with disasters in the
field, owing to the inadequacy of the standing army both in numbers
and efficiency,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and end with a political crisis of greater or
less magnitude over the donative grievance, which naturally gave an
ambitious general an opportunity of using the support of his troops to
further his own ends. The work of Augustus in bringing order out of
this chaos, providing forces adequate to the needs of the state, and
re-establishing over them the control of the central government, is not
the least of his administrative triumphs.</p>

<p>As a preliminary he accepted, as was perhaps inevitable, the principle
of a standing army of professional soldiers. This step has of late been
severely criticized, especially by admirers of the Continental system,
but it is difficult to see how short-service levies could have proved
adequate to the defence of frontiers which were, for all practical
purposes, more distant from Rome than Peshawur is from Aldershot. The
other alternative, to entrust the provincials with the defence of
their own borders, was not in harmony with his general policy, nor, it
may be said, was the time ripe for such a step. The words which the
third-century historian and administrator, Dio Cassius, puts into the
mouth of Maecenas in dealing with this question were written doubtless
with reference to the conditions of his own time, but they may
certainly be applied to the earlier period, and in essence they still
hold good to-day.</p>

<p>‘You will be wise to maintain a permanent force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατιώτας
ἀθανάτους</span>) raised from the citizens, the subjects, and the allies
distributed throughout all the provinces in larger or smaller bodies,
as necessity requires. These troops must always remain in arms and
be drilled constantly; at the most suitable points they must prepare
themselves winter quarters, and they must serve for a fixed period
calculated to allow them a little freedom after their discharge before
old age comes on. For we can no longer rely upon forces called out
for the occasion, owing to the distance which separates us from the
borders of our Empire and the enemies which we have upon every side.
If we allow all our subjects who are of military age to possess arms
and undergo a military training, there will be a continual series
of riots and civil wars, while if, on the other hand, we check all
military activity on their part, we shall run the risk of finding
nothing but raw and untrained troops when we need a contingent for our
assistance.’<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>The solution which Augustus found for this problem was then to revise
the military system so that, while using as much as possible of the
available material, he did not disturb the political conditions on
which the equilibrium of the State depended. For it was no part
of his intention materially to alter the structure of the Empire
as an aggregate of states possessed of greater or less powers of
self-government, held together by their subordination to Rome and
withheld by their position from any independent external policy.
Whatever possibilities he may have contemplated for the future he made
himself few attempts to further the process of unification either by
reducing the inhabitants of the privileged states to a lower grade
or by the more generous policy of making wide extensions of the
franchise and creating by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> this means a new imperial citizenship. This
difference of status among the inhabitants of the Empire was naturally
reflected in the military system. The <em>cives Romani</em>&mdash;that is to say,
the inhabitants of Italy and of the few enfranchised communities among
the provinces&mdash;furnished the new Household Troops, and the greater
part, at any rate, of the recruits for the legions, and paid for their
superior position as the ruling race by contributing much more heavily
in proportion to their numbers than any other class in the population.
The nominally independent monarchs of the client kingdoms were allowed
and encouraged to maintain armies, often of considerable size, under
their own control, and frequently led in person the contingents which
they were called upon to bring to the aid of the regular troops when
hostilities were taking place near their borders. These contingents
were often numerous and capable of rendering valuable service. Thus
Rhoemetalces of Thrace assisted in the suppression of the dangerous
Pannonian revolt of 6-9, and Ptolemaeus of Mauretania was publicly
honoured for his loyal co-operation against the African rebel
Tacfarinas.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Along the eastern frontier, kingdoms of this type, the
wreckage of the old Hellenistic system, were more numerous and played
a more important part. Thus Antiochus III of Commagene, Agrippa II,
Sohaemus of Emesa, and Malchus of Damascus contributed 15,000 men to
the army which Vespasian led into Palestine in the spring of 67.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
Even the more autonomous city states seem to have retained a militia
which was occasionally made use of. So late as the reign of Hadrian,
in the army which Arrian led against the Alani, we find a contingent
from the ‘free’ city of Trapezus, which is reckoned among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">
σύμμαχοι</span> as opposed to the regular imperial troops.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> A similar
freedom from the direct control of Roman officers was permitted to
the chiefs of some of the border tribes, who were allowed to lead
their own clansmen to battle. To this type of militia belong the
<em>tumultuariae catervae Germanorum cis Rhenum colentium</em>, including the
Batavians under their <em>dux</em> Chariovalda, who serve in the campaigns of
Germanicus,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and the levies of the Dalmatian clans who started the
rebellion of 6.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Last come the permanently embodied regiments raised from the subject
communities, the auxilia properly so called, who form the subject
of this treatise. Here, probably more than in any other department
of the military system of the Empire, we can trace the results of
Augustus’s own activity. Regiments of this kind had, as we have seen,
existed under the Republic, but they had probably been few in number
and the incidence of the levy had been uneven and capricious. Under
Augustus not only was the number of regiments largely increased&mdash;we
hear of no less than fourteen alae and seventy cohorts taking part in
the Pannonian War of 6-9<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>&mdash;but the inscriptions show us that, with
the exception of Greece, always the spoiled child of Roman sentiment,
every quarter of the Empire contributed its quota. Details respecting
the incidence of this levy on different provinces, and the methods
of organization and recruiting, will be found in later sections. It
will be sufficient to say here that while the subject communities
had probably more reason than any other class to complain of the
military demands of the state, the burden was at least more equitably
distributed than under the Republic and the total contribution
required, in most cases at any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> not excessive. It is natural to
suppose that the fixing of the quota supplied by each community was
connected with the drawing up of the census, which placed the taxation
of the Empire for the first time on an organized basis, and it seems
probable that more evidence might show a reciprocal variation between
the two forms of contribution required. We know, for instance, that
the Batavians were altogether excused from the payment of tribute on
account of the size and value of their contingent, and this case was
probably not exceptional.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>In all this it is easy to see how much Augustus owes to the
institutions of the Republic, and when we come to consider details his
debt becomes even more apparent. A standing army consisting of legions
of <em>cives Romani</em> and smaller units of <em>peregrini</em>, supported in the
field by contingents from allied and nominally independent states, was
already in existence. His task was merely to introduce such changes as
might obviate the mistakes and failures of the past, and to establish
principles which should make for permanence and stability. For in
accepting the principle of maintaining a standing army Augustus could
not have been blind to the political dangers which this institution
brought with it. He endeavoured to meet them by fixing the conditions
of service, in particular the sum which a soldier might claim at his
discharge, and by establishing a special treasury from which those
claims might be satisfied, thus accustoming the troops to look to the
central government, not to their generals, for rewards due to them.
Moreover, in this department of the state even Augustus allowed no
respect for constitutional forms to veil or weaken his authority.
When in 69 the legions on the Upper Rhine tore down the <em>imagines</em> of
Galba and swore allegiance to the <em>oblitterata iam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span> nomina senatus
populique Romani</em> it was a manifest sign that after a century of peace
a new period of anarchy had begun.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Since this military system, with its division of the troops into
categories differing from each other in status and prestige, reflected
the general conditions prevalent in the Empire, so it was inevitable
that a change in these conditions should have its effect also upon the
army. How far the political developments of the first century were
foreseen or intended by Augustus it is perhaps impossible to say;
it is certain, at any rate, that his system was capable of adapting
itself to them. One of these developments was a steady increase in the
power of the central government and a disappearance of all forms of
local autonomy which involved a division of authority. By the reign of
Vespasian almost all the great client kingdoms had been more or less
peaceably absorbed into the ordinary provincial system. Cappadocia
was annexed in 17, Mauretania in 39, Thrace in 46, Pontus in 63, and
Commagene in 73. The troops which these kingdoms had maintained were
naturally taken into the Roman service, transformed into auxiliary
regiments, and lost the privilege which attached to their former
condition of serving only in local campaigns. One instance of such a
transference, in the case of a regiment which had been in the service
of the kings of Pontus, is mentioned in Tacitus,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> and we also meet
with Hemeseni on the Danube,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Commageni in Africa and Noricum,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
and the successors of one of Herod’s old Samaritan regiments in
Mauretania.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The resentment with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> which the new conditions of
service were sometimes received is an instructive comment on the wisdom
of Augustus’s policy in not enforcing their universal applicability
at an earlier date. The Thracians, for example, rose in open revolt
when they were first summoned to supply a contingent for service at
a distance from their own borders.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Somewhat similar was the fate
of the border militia on the Rhine and Danube. On the latter frontier
the revolt of 6-9 showed at an early date the dangers of the system.
After its suppression the clan chiefs seem, in many cases at any rate,
to have been deposed and replaced by Roman officials,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> regiments
of Pannonians and Dalmatians were raised and transferred to other
provinces, and a garrison was imported from outside to control the
country.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> On the Rhine the process was a more gradual one. The
Batavi, for example, whom we have noticed serving in the campaigns
of Germanicus as a clan levy under their <em>dux</em> Chariovalda, seem to
have been organized in regular auxiliary regiments by the middle
of the first century,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> although they still retained, in common
with many other corps of Rhenish auxilia, their clan chiefs as their
<em>praefecti</em>.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In the year 69 we also find the Helvetii still
responsible for maintaining the garrison of a fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> within their
borders, and a militia existing in Raetia capable of supplementing
the garrison of regular auxilia.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Some even of the Gallic states,
which were more distant from the frontier, sent contingents to support
Vitellius, which were not, however, regarded as a very sensible
addition to his forces.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Probably these last vestiges of independent organization and control
were swept away at the time of the reorganization of the Rhine army in
70, after the rebellion of Civilis. From this date onward there are at
any rate few traces here or elsewhere of any use of irregulars of this
type by the military authorities. This militia, which might have proved
invaluable in the days to come as a national reserve, fell a victim,
together with the local autonomy on which it was based, to the growing
tendency towards centralization which marks the first and second
centuries. The supersession of local officials by the agents of a
centralized bureaucracy in the civil administration coincides with the
complete transference of the burden of the defence of the state to the
shoulders of a professional army. It is the purpose of the following
chapters to discuss one part of this army, the auxilia, to trace its
organization and the part which it played in frontier defence, and to
illustrate from this study the lines on which the military system of
the Empire developed and the causes of its failure.</p>

<span class="small">THE STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION OF THE AUXILIARY REGIMENTS</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the death of Augustus to the period when the frontier defences
first began to collapse under the strain of the barbarian invasions,
more than two centuries later, the imperial army presents a picture of
military conservatism unrivalled in history. Not only does the original
distinction between the legions of <em>cives Romani</em> and the auxilia of
<em>peregrini</em> remain throughout the basis of its organization, but even
individual corps show a marvellous power of vitality. Dio Cassius,
writing at the beginning of the third century, notes that, of the
twenty-five legions in existence in 14, eighteen still survived in his
own day, and epigraphical evidence shows that scores even of the more
easily destructible auxiliary regiments could claim as long a record.
In appearance, indeed, the only considerable change introduced into
the organization of the auxilia during this period was the addition of
the <em>numeri</em> in the second century to the <em>alae</em> and <em>cohortes</em> which
had previously been the only units employed. It is true, of course,
that this conservatism was in some respects rather superficial, and
that, while administrative forms and nomenclature remained unaltered,
in more essential matters the army had been deeply affected by the
tendencies of the age. It is still, however, possible, while paying due
attention to these changes, to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> the two centuries which follow
the death of Augustus as a single period in the history of the auxilia;
it is only amid the confusion caused by the barbarian invasions of the
third century and the subsequent attempts at reorganization that we
definitely lose sight of our old landmarks.</p>

<p>Leaving out of account for the moment the <em>numeri</em>, which, as late
creations with a special significance, are reserved for future
discussion, let us commence with the <em>alae</em> and <em>cohortes</em>, which
remained throughout this period the units of auxiliary cavalry and
infantry respectively.</p>

<p>Both these terms, although their history is widely different, originate
in the military terminology of the Republic. The term <em>cohors</em> had been
originally applied to the infantry contingents of the Italian <em>socii</em>,
which were not united in legions after the model of the levies of
<em>cives Romani</em>, and it was naturally retained after the disappearance
of the <em>socii</em> to describe the similar tactical units of provincial
auxilia.</p>

<p>The term <em>ala</em> originated as a metaphorical description of the two
divisions into which the contingents of <em>socii</em> were formed, which
were stationed in the normal republican order of battle on either
flank of the legions. After the disappearance of the <em>socii</em> the term
was applied in a more restricted sense to the two flanking divisions
in which the average Roman general massed all his available cavalry.
This use of the word continued down to the last days of the Republic.
When, for instance, the author of the <cite>De bello Africo</cite> writes, ‘Caesar
<em>alteram</em> alam mittit qui satagentibus celeriter occurreret,’<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> or
Cicero says of his son in the <cite>De Officiis</cite>, ‘Quo tamen in bello cum
te Pompeius <em>alteri</em> alae praefecisset, magnam laudem et a summo viro,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>et ab exercitu consequebare equitando, iaculando &hellip;’<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> the word
is clearly being used in this sense, and does not refer to a regiment
of any fixed size. In fact the cavalry of the <em>socii</em> never seem to
have been organized in larger units than <em>turmae</em>, and the auxiliary
levies naturally adopted the same formation. It has already been
noticed that some of the Spanish auxiliaries who served in the Social
War are officially described as belonging to a <em>turma Salluitana</em>.
Occasional phrases in Livy, such as the statement that the Aetolian
cavalry contingent, in the campaign of 171 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, was <em>alae
unius instar</em>, do not seem to prove anything more than that the
historian used the technical terms of his own age to make his narrative
clearer.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> This usage, however, shows that Livy was familiar with
the restricted meaning of the word&mdash;that is to say, the ala must have
been a recognized institution in the reign of Augustus, and we may add
that Velleius states that fourteen alae were employed in the Pannonian
campaigns of 6-9 in which he himself had served.</p>

<p>It is improbable, however, that the ala was a creation of Augustus,
although he may have determined its exact size and organization. In
Caesar’s account of his Gallic campaigns we find frequent mention
of contingents of tribal cavalry serving as independent units under
officers bearing the title of <em>praefecti equitum</em>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and these units
must have been much larger than <em>turmae</em>. The organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> of these
regiments, originally of a purely temporary kind, must have been placed
on a more permanent basis when many of them were taken out of their own
country to serve in the Civil Wars, and it would have been natural that
a new term should be used to describe them.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Evidence in support of this conjecture, which is, as we have seen,
lacking in the writings of Caesar and his continuators, has been
sought for elsewhere. The majority of Caesar’s <em>praefecti equitum</em>
seem to have been tribal chiefs; one may cite, for example, the Aeduan
Dumnorix,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> the heroic veteran Vertiscus,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and the two treacherous
Allobroges, Roucillus and Egus, the sons of Adbucillus.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> On the
other hand, when we meet with an ala Scaevae on an early inscription,
it is difficult to avoid agreeing with Mommsen that it was called
after Caesar’s well-known officer of that name.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Many other cavalry
regiments, which are shown by epigraphical evidence to have existed
at an early date and to have been Gallic in composition, bear titles
similarly formed from personal names.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> suggested that
these corps, or at any rate the majority of them, represent tribal
contingents embodied by Caesar at the time of the Civil Wars under the
title of <em>alae</em> and placed under his veteran officers. Thus during
this period the use of the term <em>ala</em> in the restricted sense would
be already known, although only the older and wider use appears in
literature. How slowly the new expression won favour is shown by the
fact that during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius the officers
commanding these regiments were usually described on inscriptions
simply as <em>praefectus equitum</em>, and it was not until after this that
the title <em>praefectus alae</em> came to be generally adopted.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough, we find very few cohorts with titles which suggest a
similar history.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Probably in this case Augustus’s reorganization
was more thorough and the existing regiments had not, like some of
Caesar’s corps of Gallic cavalry, a record of individual achievement
which might exempt them from its scope.</p>

<p><em>Size of regiments.</em> In discussing the size of the auxiliary regiments
we have two questions to settle, the numbers of the establishment and
the actual strength at which the regiments were maintained. As regards
the first question, the evidence of Hyginus<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and the inscriptions
shows us that both <em>alae</em> and <em>cohortes</em> were known as <em>miliariae</em> or
<em>quingenariae</em>&mdash;that is to say, they contained, roughly speaking, 500
or 1,000 men each. The smaller unit seems to have been preferred in the
first century, while the larger predominates among the corps raised
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> Trajan and his successors. The exact theoretical size, both of
the regiments themselves and of the centuries and <em>turmae</em> into which
they were divided, is more difficult to determine. Hyginus states that
an <em>ala quingenaria</em> was divided into sixteen <em>turmae</em>, and an <em>ala
miliaria</em> into twenty-four.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He does not state the number of men
in a <em>turma</em> in either case, and it seems impossible to arrive at any
certainty on the basis of figures found elsewhere in his treatise.
Turning to epigraphical evidence we find an inscription from Coptos
which describes the composition of a <em>vexillatio</em> drawn from three alae
and seven cohorts, as: ‘<em>Alarum III: dec(uriones) V, dupl(icarius)
I, sesquiplic(arii) IIII, equites CCCCXXIIII. Cohortium VII:
centuriones X, eq(uites) LXI, mil(ites) DCCLXXXIIX</em>’.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Von
Domaszewski suggests that the cavalry in this detachment are to be
divided into ten <em>turmae</em> of 42 men, each commanded by a <em>decurio</em>, a
<em>duplicarius</em>, or a <em>sesquiplicarius</em>, and that this figure represents
the theoretical strength of the <em>turma</em> in an <em>ala miliaria</em>.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> In an
<em>ala quingenaria</em>, on the other hand, the <em>turma</em> probably contained
only 30 men.</p>

<p>This seems to be as near certainty as we are likely to arrive in the
present state of our evidence, unless indeed we take literally a
statement of Arrian that an <em>ala</em> contained 512 men, a total which
would presumably give 32 men to the <em>turma</em>.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Arrian is, of course,
the best authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> on the imperial army whom we possess, but the
remark in question is a parenthesis inserted into an account of the
ideal establishment of a Hellenistic army, and he may have meant no
more than that the unit under discussion corresponded roughly with a
Roman <em>ala quingenaria</em>. More satisfactory and conclusive evidence will
perhaps be found when the barracks of an ala in a frontier fort have
been accurately planned.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>The size of the auxiliary cohorts is a matter of even greater
difficulty. Hyginus states, and there seems no reason to doubt his
statement, that a <em>cohors miliaria</em> was divided into ten centuries, a
<em>cohors quingenaria</em> into six.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Archaeological evidence supports
this statement and suggests further that the centuries were in each
case of the same size, since the centurial barracks in the fort at
Housesteads, in Northumberland, which was occupied by a <em>cohors
miliaria</em>, offer almost precisely the same accommodation as those
in the Scottish fort at Newstead, which are clearly designed to
accommodate two <em>cohortes quingenariae</em>. The question to be decided is
whether these centuries contained 80 or 100 men each. In either case,
one of the titles must be a misnomer, since six centuries of 100 would
make a <em>cohors quingenaria</em> consist of 600 men, while ten centuries
of 80 would only give 800 men for a <em>cohors miliaria</em>. On the whole,
although Hyginus suggests the higher figure, the lower is probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> to
be preferred. Certainly the Coptos inscription cited above, which is
probably the most valuable evidence which we possess, clearly indicates
centuries of 80. The most important evidence on the other side is that
of Josephus, who describes some cohorts which belonged to the Syrian
army in 67 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> as containing <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ χιλίους πεζούς</span>.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
His succeeding statement, however, that other cohorts, by which
<em>cohortes equitatae quingenariae</em> are apparently meant, contained 600
infantry and 120 cavalry, suggests that he may be basing his reckoning
simply on the number of centuries. Few would defend his calculation
in the second instance, and he may be equally wrong in the first. On
the whole, therefore, it seems safer to assume establishments of 480
and 800 men for <em>cohortes quingenariae</em> and <em>miliariae</em> respectively,
although it remains, of course, possible that the size of the cohorts
was altered between the Jewish war of 66-70 and the period of the
erection of those frontier forts upon which we have been relying for
our evidence.</p>

<p>The last question to be settled in this connexion is that of the
<em>cohortes equitatae</em>, in which a proportion of the men were mounted,
which form a peculiar and interesting feature of the imperial army.
Corps in which infantry and cavalry fought together had of course
always been common,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> but the idea was probably revived by the Romans
from observing the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> the German tribes, from whom Julius
obtained a contingent accustomed to fight in this manner.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> It is
certainly significant that one of the earliest of these regiments
known to us from inscriptions is a <em>cohors Ubiorum</em>.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> There is,
however, no later evidence for the employment of these tactics, and the
continued use of <em>cohortes equitatae</em> is due rather to the necessity
of having detachments of mounted men at as many frontier stations as
possible. The <em>equites cohortales</em> should be reckoned rather as mounted
infantry than cavalry, since we learn from a fragment of Hadrian’s
address to the army in Africa that they were worse mounted than the
<em>equites alares</em>, and less skilled in cavalry manœuvres.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> As
regards the strength of these regiments and the proportion of mounted
to unmounted men, Hyginus states that the <em>cohors miliaria equitata</em>
contained 760 infantry and 240 cavalry, while the <em>cohors quingenaria</em>
contained six centuries, and in other respects, ‘<em>in dimidio eandem
rationem continet</em>’&mdash;that is to say, it apparently had 380 infantry and
120 cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> The figures for the mounted men are probably correct,
and, since we learn from an inscription that there were four decurions
to a <em>cohors quingenaria</em>, we may presume that the <em>turmae</em> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> 30
strong.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> This agrees very well with the Egyptian vexillation cited
above, which included 61 <em>equites cohortales</em>&mdash;that is to say, 2
<em>turmae</em>. On the other hand, there is considerable reason for supposing
that the figures for the infantry are schematic and incorrect. It is
sufficient here to remark that centuries of 76 could not be divided
into <em>contubernia</em> of either 8 or 10, and that the 380 men of Hyginus’s
<em>cohors quingenaria</em> could not even be divided evenly among six
centuries. The question cannot be settled with certainty until forts
occupied by regiments of this class have been planned, but it seems
probable that while the number of the centuries remained unaltered the
complement of each was reduced from 80 to 60, or possibly to 64, if
it was thought desirable to retain the division into <em>contubernia</em> of
8.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Having endeavoured to determine the theoretical establishment of the
auxiliary regiments, it remains to discover how far this corresponded
to the actual strength at which they were maintained, and here our
evidence is scanty, and likely to remain so. Fortunately, the discovery
in Egypt of some of the official papers of the Cohors I Augusta
Praetoria Lusitanorum has thrown some light on the question. On January
1, 156, this regiment had on its books 6 centurions, 3 decurions, 114
mounted infantry, 19 camel-riders (<em>dromedarii</em>), and 363 infantry,
making, with the <em>praefectus</em>, a total of 506 men. Between January
and May, 18 recruits were enrolled, 15 infantry, an <em>eques</em>, a
<em>dromedarius</em>, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> decurion.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> These figures agree fairly well
with the arrangement suggested above, although the <em>dromedarii</em> are an
additional complication, and the regiment appears even to have exceeded
its ‘paper-strength’. This, however, may be easily accounted for if we
imagine that a number of men had served their term and were about to be
discharged. Unfortunately, this document remains isolated, and further
evidence is not likely to be forthcoming.</p>

<p><em>Conditions of service.</em> Questions concerning the method of enlistment
for the auxiliary regiments are reserved, on account of their connexion
with the broader issues raised by the whole recruiting system, for
discussion in a later section. For the present it will be sufficient
to discuss the conditions of service in this branch of the army, as
they are laid down in the so-called <em>diplomata militaria</em>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> These
documents, of which we possess some 70 or 80 examples dealing with the
auxilia, are small bronze tablets, issued originally to individual
soldiers, recording the privileges granted to them either after their
discharge or after they had completed a term of 25 years. The reason
for this variation seems to be that while the <em>praemia militiae</em>
were always conferred after the regulation number of years had been
served, it was often the practice to retain the men with the colours
for some years longer before finally discharging them. This practice,
which we hear of in the early empire as a standing grievance of the
legionaries,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> seems to have prevailed also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> among the auxilia during
the first century.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> After 107, however, we have no instances of the
<em>praemia</em> unpreceded by discharge, a change which is probably due to
the perfection of organization, and can be traced also in the legions.</p>

<p>Previous to the reign of Antoninus Pius, the privileges granted to
the recipient of a diploma include citizenship for himself, the full
legalization of any matrimonial union into which he has entered or
shall enter in the future (<em>conubium</em>), and civic rights for his wife,
children, and descendants. If he already possessed a family, the
names of his wife and children follow his own on the diploma, and the
frequency of this occurrence shows the extent to which the military
authorities permitted the soldiers to form family ties while on active
service.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> The significance of this fact and its effect on the
character of the army will be discussed in a later section.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius, a change takes place
in that part of the formula which concerns the grant of citizenship.
In place of the words <em>ipsis liberis posterisque eorum civitatem dedit
et conubium cum uxoribus</em>, &amp;c., we read in all the later examples,
<em>civitatem Romanam, qui eorum non haberent, dedit et conubium cum
uxoribus</em>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> The first inference to be drawn from this alteration
is that there now existed a numerous group of auxiliary soldiers who
possessed the <em>civitas</em> before their discharge, and we are probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
justified in the further inference that many actually possessed it when
they were enrolled. It has been noted, for example, that on a document
dating from the reign of Trajan, six recruits accepted for the Cohors
III Ituraeorum all have the <em>tria nomina</em>.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In this change, then,
we have a clear instance of the extent to which the franchise was now
diffused throughout the Empire.</p>

<p>The omission of the phrase <em>liberis posterisque eorum</em>, on the other
hand, suggests the opposite tendency. It cannot, of course, mean that
children born after their father’s discharge would not be <em>cives</em>,
for their status would be secured by the grant of <em>conubium</em>, but
it seems clear that those born before it no longer acquired the
citizenship with him. This is supported not only by the absence
of all mention of children on the later
diplomata,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> but by the
phraseology of an Egyptian document dealing with an
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκρισις</span>
of the year 148 which distinguishes two classes of veterans,
<span class="gesperrt" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνειοι</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὲν ἐπιτυχόντες σὺν τέκνοις καὶ ἐγγόνοις,</span>
<span class="gesperrt" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕτεροι</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόνοι τῆς
Ῥωμαίων ποτειτείας</span> (<em>sic</em>) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καὶ ἐπιγαμίας πρὸς γυναῖκας ἃς
τότε εἶχον, ὅτε τούτοις ἡ πολιτεία ἐδόθη</span>,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> &amp;c. Clearly we have
here a translation of both types of formula, and the translator gave
to the second the same meaning as that suggested above. Clearly,
too, the change was considered an important one since the veterans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
discharged before and after it are thus divided into two groups. In
view of the prevailing policy of the imperial government with respect
to the extension of the <em>civitas</em> this step has a curiously retrograde
appearance, and it is difficult to see the motives which suggested it.
Possibly it was merely desired to get rid of an anomalous situation
by which the auxiliaries had previously occupied a more privileged
position than the Household Troops.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> In any case, even after this
restriction, there can be little doubt that the grant of the <em>civitas</em>
with the improvement in civil status which it brought to the recipient,
and the increased possibilities which it offered to his children,
must have done much to popularize the service. We have seen that the
idea of such a reward did not originate with the Empire, but it was
probably not until the reorganization of the army by Augustus that it
was regularly conferred and the years of service required to earn it
definitely fixed.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>We do not know whether at the time of their discharge the auxiliaries
also received, like the legionaries, a grant of money or land in lieu
of a pension. It seems certain that their status excluded them from
a share in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> <em>donativa</em>, which the emperors distributed among
the troops at their accession, and on other special occasions, and
that they could only receive the <em>dona militaria</em> after a special
preliminary grant of the civitas.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> That such grants were made, even
to whole regiments at a time, is shown by the number of cohorts which
commemorate the receipt of this honour by employing the title <em>civium
Romanorum</em>.</p>

<p>On the still more important matter of the ordinary pay of the auxiliary
regiments an almost equal uncertainty prevails. Our only two pieces of
evidence on the subject, a passage in Tacitus and a phrase in Hadrian’s
address to the garrison of Africa,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> tell us nothing more than that
the <em>equites cohortales</em> were paid on a higher scale than the infantry,
but received in their turn less than the <em>equites alares</em>, a preference
in favour of the mounted men, which is not so great as appears at first
sight, since it is clear that they were responsible for the upkeep
of their own horses. The chief defect of these passages is that they
do not mention the amount of the pay in any of the three cases. Our
only basis for calculation is the fact that a legionary considered it
promotion to be made <em>duplicarius alae</em>; hence the pay of an ordinary
cavalryman must have been more than half that of a legionary. On <em>a
priori</em> considerations it can hardly have been less, if, as Hadrian’s
speech suggests, he paid for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> his own arms and mount, and if he also,
like the legionaries, had the cost of his rations deducted from his
pay. On the whole, however, it seems best to defer speculation until
further evidence is forthcoming.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p><em>Internal organization.</em> As is only natural in the case of a
professional army with so long a term of service, the internal
organization of the auxiliary regiments reveals a far more complicated
system of grades and promotions than anything which the ancient world
had yet known. The epigraphical evidence is abundant, and the efforts
of modern scholars, particularly von Domaszewski in his monumental
treatise, <cite>Die Rangordnung des r&ouml;mischen Heeres</cite>, have done much to
make the main lines of the system clear. Difficulties in detail still
remain, but we may hope for their ultimate solution.</p>

<p>The commanding officer of an <em>ala quingenaria</em> or <em>miliaria</em>, or of
a <em>cohors quingenaria</em> bore the title of <em>praefectus</em>. <em>Cohortes
miliariae</em> and the <em>cohortes civium Romanorum</em>, which occupied
an exceptional position,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> were commanded by <em>tribuni</em>. Early
inscriptions also mention a <em>subpraefectus alae</em> and a <em>subpraefectus
cohortis</em>, but these posts seem later to have been abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
later times in case of the absence of the <em>praefectus</em>, his place seems
to have been filled by an officer placed temporarily in charge with the
title of <em>praepositus</em> or <em>curator</em>. Questions concerning the order of
precedence among the <em>praefecti</em> and <em>tribuni</em>, and their place in the
military hierarchy generally, are so closely connected with the method
of selection and appointment of these officers at different periods,
that they are best left for future discussion.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> It is only important
here to note that they usually entered the service with this rank, and
that it is very rare to find the regular commander either of an ala or
cohort drawn from among the lower officers.</p>

<p>The remaining ‘commissioned officers’, as we should call them, are
represented by the troop and company commanders, the decurions who
commanded the <em>turmae</em> of the ala, and the centurions and decurions
of the cohorts. The senior officer in each class was styled <em>decurio
princeps</em> or <em>centurio princeps</em>,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> but apart from this we cannot
trace any regular order of precedence with fixed titles such as is
found among the legionary centurions. As regards the respective
position of infantry and cavalry officers, the <em>decurio alae</em> ranked
highest. This is shown clearly, as von Domaszewski has pointed out, by
the frequent employment of this officer as <em>praepositus cohortis</em>.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
On the other hand, among the officers of the cohorts the centurions
ranked above the decurions who commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> the mounted men, where such
existed. In one inscription, which seems to have included all the
officers of a <em>cohors equitata</em>, the centurions come first on the list,
and in the Coptos inscription, so often cited, the officers of the 61
<em>equites cohortales</em> are not mentioned at all.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> The difference in
rank cannot, however, have been very great since all these officers
could be promoted to the post of legionary centurion without any
intervening step, although this distinction seems to have been
conferred most freely upon the decurions of the alae. In these cases it
was of course necessary for the auxiliary officer to have acquired the
<em>civitas</em> either by serving his full time or by a special grant before
his promotion.</p>

<p>Throughout the period these posts seem usually to have been filled by
promotion from the lower ranks, although we also find instances of
legionaries being given commissioned rank in the auxiliary regiments,
and it is officers of this class who seem most frequently to have
secured further promotion to the legionary centurionate.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Von
Domaszewski wishes to consider that these transfers were especially
characteristic of the early days of the imperial army, and that a
deliberate attempt was then made to provide every auxiliary regiment
with a staff of ex-legionaries. With this suggestion, however, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
difficult to agree; not only is the epigraphical evidence insufficient
to prove such a wholesale use of imported officers, but the cases known
to us are by no means confined to the first fifty years of the Empire.
Further, as will be shown later, the arrangement does not harmonize
with the general character of the early <em>auxilia</em>.</p>

<p>The holders of subordinate posts, who ranked below the centurion or
decurion, may be divided, following the arrangement adopted by von
Domaszewski, into two groups.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> The members of the first group
practically correspond to our non-commissioned officers, and are able
to command small detachments or to take the place, if necessary, of
the company officers. These alone, and the holders of certain higher
administrative posts, to which the <em>taktische Chargen</em> gave access,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
have a legitimate claim to the title of <em>principales</em>. The members of
the second group did not, strictly speaking, rank above the privates,
but they were granted freedom from certain routine duties in return
for special services which they discharged, and were distinguished in
consequence by the title of <em>immunes</em>.</p>

<p>It is of course often difficult to ascertain whether a particular post
falls into the higher or lower group, and this is especially the case
with the standard-bearers, who occupy a position of peculiar importance
in the military system. In the ala each troop had its own flag
carried by the <em>signifer turmae</em>, but there seems also to have been a
regimental standard, the bearer of which was known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span> the <em>vexillarius
alae</em>.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> A few inscriptions also mention an <em>imaginifer</em>, but it
is not clear whether this officer always or at all periods found a
place on the staff.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> In a cohort, on the other hand, each century
seems to have had its <em>signifer</em>, and each turma of mounted men its
<em>vexillarius</em>, but it does not appear that there was a regimental
standard, any more than there existed at this date a standard for
each cohort of a legion. This at least is implied by Tacitus in his
description of the entry of the Vitellian army into Rome, when he
mentions the <em>alarum signa</em> by the side of the <em>legionum aquilae</em>,
but says nothing of the ensigns of the cohorts.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> We must suppose,
then, that the <em>imaginifer cohortis</em>, who is mentioned on inscriptions,
was not regarded as the regimental standard-bearer any more than the
<em>imaginifer legionis</em>.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this difference in organization the company and troop
standard-bearers of the cohorts rank among the <em>principales</em>, while in
the alae only the regimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span> standard-bearer is included in the higher
group, and the <em>signiferi turmae</em> sink to the position of <em>immunes</em>.</p>

<p>Returning, then, to the ala we may place at the head of the
<em>principales</em> the <em>vexillarius</em>, and next to him the <em>imaginifer</em>,
when this officer existed. Other members of this class were the
non-commissioned officers of every turma, the <em>duplicarius</em> and
<em>sesquiplicarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> who derived their titles from the fact that
they were paid twice and one and a half times the private’s pay
respectively, an institution found in the Hellenistic military
system from which it was probably borrowed.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Lastly we should
perhaps add the <em>optio</em>, who commanded the escort of the <em>praefectus</em>
(<em>singulares</em>).<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>To the lower group, the <em>immunes</em>, belong the <em>signifer</em>,
<em>custos armorum</em>, and <em>curator</em> attached to every turma,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> the
<em>cornicularius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> <em>actarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> <em>strator</em>,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> <em>stator</em>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
<em>librarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and <em>beneficiarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> who form the clerical
and administrative staff of the <em>praefectus</em>, and his escort, the
<em>singulares</em>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> In determining the position of the holders of these
posts among the <em>immunes</em> we are supported by the analogy of the
Equites Singulares Imperatoris, a corps modelled upon and to a certain
extent recruited from the auxiliary cavalry. The list of a <em>turma</em> of
this regiment contained on a Roman inscription gives the following
arrangement:<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>
nomina turmae<br />
<br />
Iul(ius) Mascel(lus) dec(urio)<br />
Nonius Severus dup(licarius)<br />
Iul(ius) Victorinus sesq(uiplicarius)<br />
Aur(elius) Mucatral<br />
Aur(elius) Lucius<br />
Ael(ius) Crescens sig(nifer)<br />
Aur(elius) Victor arm(orum custos)<br />
Aur(elius) Atero cur(ator)<br />

Cl(audius) Victorinus lib(rarius)<br />
Iul(ius) Vindex bf (beneficiarius)<br />
17 names of equites follow.<br />
</p>

<p>The fact that two privates occupy the fourth and fifth places shows
clearly that the holders of all the posts mentioned lower in the list
belong to the <em>immunes</em>. Had it not been for this piece of evidence we
might have been tempted to place the <em>signifer turmae</em> in the higher
category. The analogy of the Equites Singulares also suggests that
we may include the <em>bucinator</em> and <em>tubicen</em> among the <em>immunes</em> of
the ala,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> and we have also to add the <em>medicus</em>, whose somewhat
exceptional position is discussed later.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>A distinction between the <em>principales</em> and <em>immunes</em> of the cohorts
may be based partly upon the principles already adopted for the ala,
partly upon the analogy of the legion, the organization of which was
clearly followed in several respects. On these grounds we may class as
<em>principales</em> the <em>imaginifer cohortis</em>, the <em>signifer</em>, <em>optio</em>, and
<em>tesserarius</em> of each century, and the <em>optio</em> and <em>vexillarius</em> of
each turma in the <em>cohortes equitatae</em>. The case of the <em>optio</em>, who
commanded, if necessary, in the place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> centurion or decurion,
may be taken for granted. It may also be noted that both <em>optio</em> and
<em>vexillarius</em> could be promoted to the position of decurion without any
intervening step.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The <em>tesserarius</em>, whose main duty consisted
in receiving from the centurion the orders and password for the day
and transmitting them to the men, is found in charge of a detachment
on special duty,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> as is also the <em>imaginifer cohortis</em>.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> The
<em>signifer</em>,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> lastly, can hardly have had a position inferior to
that of the <em>vexillarius</em> or <em>tesserarius</em>, and would indeed rank
higher than the latter if the analogy of the legions holds good. As
regards the <em>immunes</em>, the officer commanding a cohort possessed a
smaller administrative staff than the <em>praefectus alae</em>, including
only the <em>cornicularius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> <em>actarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> <em>librarius</em>,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
and <em>beneficiarius</em>.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The musicians possibly include the
<em>cornicen</em><a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> as well as the <em>tubicen</em><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> and the <em>bucinator</em><a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>,
and the post of <em>mensor</em> seems to be confined to the cohorts.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> At
least no inscription has yet mentioned one among the <em>immunes</em> of the
ala.</p>

<p>Finally, as regards the position of the <em>medici</em>, who were attached
to the cohorts as well as to the alae, a few special remarks seem
necessary. On a British inscription one of these army doctors is
described as <em>medicus ordinarius</em><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>, which would naturally mean
that he served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> in the ranks, and a passage in the <cite>Digest</cite> confirms
this by ranking the <em>medici</em> among the <em>immunes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> On the other
hand, M. Ulpius Sporus, who is described in an inscription erected by
his freedmen at Ferentinum in Etruria as <em>medicus alae Indianae et
tertiae Astorum</em> (sic)<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>, seems to be on rather a higher level,
as also M. Rubrius Zosimus of Ostia, who was doctor to the Cohors IV
Aquitanorum in Germania Superior in the second century.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Both
these men are apparently Greeks, and can hardly have reached their
regiments by the ordinary recruiting channels.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> It has been noticed
also that the <em>medici</em> appear to have a special position in some
inscriptions of the Praetorian cohorts.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Probably, then, one may
infer two classes of <em>medici</em>, the common soldier who possessed some
elementary qualifications (first aid and blood-letting) and was given
the position of an <em>immunis</em>, and the fully-trained professional doctor
who was attached to a regiment but held no actual military rank. It
was probably to distinguish himself from the latter class that the
<em>medicus</em> of the Tungrian cohort added the word <em>ordinarius</em> to his
title.</p>

<p>As regards the rate and method of promotion, and the order of
precedence of the various posts within the two groups of <em>principales</em>
and <em>immunes</em>, we know practically nothing. There is nothing to show
that it was customary to hold several posts in a regular order,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
or to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> an <em>immunis</em> before entering the <em>principales</em>. It was
doubtless usual for a man not to receive commissioned rank without
first holding some subordinate post, but we do not know that any such
preliminary qualification was essential.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> Owing to the length of
service promotion was probably not rapid, but on the other hand the
number of posts available was very large. In an <em>ala quingenaria</em>,
for example, there were 16 decurions, 34 <em>principales</em>, and probably
over 100 <em>immunes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Thus every soldier must have felt confident
of obtaining sooner or later a position of greater ease and profit,
and this, together with the fact that the ladder of promotion led to
commissioned rank, and even to the coveted legionary centurionate, must
have increased the attractions of the profession.</p>

<p><em>Titles of the regiments.</em> The titles of the auxiliary regiments were
as various in form as those of the legions, and it is unnecessary to
give a complete list of them. The alae which bear a title derived from
a personal name, presumably that of their original commander, have been
mentioned already. The majority of them were probably raised during
Caesar’s Gallic campaigns or the Civil Wars, and there are few to which
a later date can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> assigned with any certainty.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> The few cohorts
known to have borne such titles are more difficult to explain, but
have perhaps a similar origin.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> Regiments raised under the Empire,
on the other hand, were usually called by the name of the tribe or
district from which they were raised, and distinguished by a number
from other corps of the same origin.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> In course of time these
ethnical titles were in many cases supplemented by others, some of
which were granted as marks of distinction and rewards for meritorious
service, while others were purely descriptive. Examples of the former
class are the title <em>civium Romanorum</em>, which indicates that on some
occasion all the members of a corps received the franchise before their
discharge,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and honorary epithets, such as <em>pia</em>, <em>fidelis</em>, or
<em>fida</em>.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> The title <em>Augusta</em> seems also to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> been granted at
all periods <em>honoris causa</em>, although some of the regiments bearing
it may date back to the beginning of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> Titles derived
from the names of later emperors, on the other hand, while they were
doubtless granted occasionally as marks of distinction, seem often
to indicate nothing more than the reign during which a regiment was
raised. Finally, from the time of Severus Antoninus onwards, every
regiment employs a secondary title, derived from the name of the
reigning emperor. A remarkable series of dedicatory inscriptions of the
Cohors I Aelia Dacorum, which was stationed during the third century
at Birdoswald (Amboglanna), on the British frontier, shows us this
regiment successively assuming the titles <em>Antoniniana</em>, <em>Gordiana</em>,
<em>Postumiana,</em> and <em>Tetriciana</em>.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>Purely descriptive titles might be derived either from the size
of the regiment (<em>miliaria</em>, <em>quingenaria</em>), its composition
(<em>equitata</em>, <em>gemina</em>),<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> its weapons (<em>scutata</em>, <em>contariorum</em>,
<em>sagittariorum</em>), or the name of the province in which it was or had
been stationed (<em>Syriaca</em>, <em>Moesiaca</em>). A frequent motive for the
assumption and accumulation of such secondary descriptive titles seems
to have been the desire of a regiment to distinguish itself from
another unit bearing the same number and ethnical title, and stationed
in the same province. This was probably the origin of the title
<em>veterana</em> or <em>veteranorum</em>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> borne by five alae and five
cohorts,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> although its interpretation is much disputed. According
to von Domaszewski, these regiments were so called because they were
originally formed of discharged veterans recalled to active service
in time of war.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Cichorius suggests that a regiment assumed this
name when another corps bearing the same number and ethnical title,
but of more recent origin, was stationed in the same province.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
This certainly furnishes the best explanation in the case of the
Cohors III Thracum c. R., and the Cohors III Thracum veteranorum,
which appear together in the Raetian diplomata for 107 and 166.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
On von Domaszewski’s theory it is difficult to see why a regiment of
recalled veterans should bear the number III, and his explanation that
‘the numbers borne by these corps are connected with the numbering
of the auxilia in the province to which they were attached after
their formation from <em>missicii</em>’ does not make matters much clearer.
Cichorius’s suggestion would also account satisfactorily for the Cohors
I Aquitanorum and the Cohors I Aquitanorum veterana, which appear
together in Germania Superior in 74,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and the Cohors I Claudia
Sugambrorum and the Cohors I Sugambrorum veterana which were stationed

the regiment mentioned by Tacitus as forming part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> garrison
of the province in the reign of Tiberius.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> In other cases where
similar duplication cannot be proved it must be remembered that our
evidence is very imperfect, and that a regiment after assuming this

disappeared.</p>

<p>These descriptive and honorary epithets, although sometimes borne
alone,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> were usually employed to supplement the original ethnical
title, with the result that after a hundred years of meritorious
service the ‘full style’ of a second-century regiment might be almost
as long and imposing as that of the emperors whom it served. As an
example, one may cite the Cohors I Breucorum quingenaria Valeria
Victrix bis torquata ob virtutem appellata equitata, which formed part
of the garrison of Raetia.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p><em>Relation of the auxilia to the legions.</em> It is perhaps relevant to
discuss here a point affecting the auxilia as a whole, namely, their
relation to the legions in the general scheme of military organization.
It is generally supposed that in those frontier armies which included
both classes of troops, a group of auxiliary regiments was definitely
attached to each legion, and such phrases as ‘a legion with its
attendant auxiliaries’ are common in writers on the military system
of the Roman Empire. Evidence as to the exact nature and even the
existence of such a connexion is, however, somewhat difficult to find.
Tacitus does, it is true, refer to the eight Batavian cohorts, who
play such an important part in the events of 69, as <em>auxilia quartae</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
<em>decimae legionis</em>, but no other passage can be quoted in the same
sense, and the connexion in this case was obviously neither close
nor durable.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> In the comparatively detailed account of the first
campaign of Bedriacum, which rests at any rate upon a good military
source, there is no suggestion that the auxilia marched or manœuvred in
separate groups, each connected with a particular legion. Certainly in
the normal order of battle throughout the first century the available
auxilia were all massed together either as a first line, or in two
flanking divisions to the right and left of the legionaries, and the
auxilia of the army which crossed the Rhine in 73 were not divided
among the legionary <em>legati</em>, but had a commander of their own.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Supporters of the legionary connexion also refer to the two diplomata
issued in the same year and on the same day (August 14, 99) to two
different groups of auxiliary regiments stationed in Moesia Inferior,
and suggest that this curious arrangement can best be explained on
the supposition that each diploma refers only to the auxilia of one
legion.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> A similar explanation suggests itself for the fact that
only one regiment is common to the two British diplomata of 103 and
105.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> It seems impossible, however, to interpret all the diplomata
in this manner. The British diploma of 124, for example, which was
issued to men from six alae and twenty-one cohorts, can hardly be
supposed to contain the auxilia of only one of the three legions then
stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span> in the province.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> In Pannonia Superior also so many
regiments are common to the five complete second-century diplomata
which we possess that we must, on this theory, refer them all to the
auxilia of one and the same legion.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> How, then, do we account for
the fact that the inscriptions of the province hardly mention any
regiments but those contained in these diplomata? In other words,
why should all our evidence refer to the auxilia of one legion, and
those attached to the other two, then stationed in the province, have
entirely disappeared?</p>

<p>A stronger argument is perhaps to be found in inscriptions which
contain the phrase <em>legio &hellip; et auxilia eius</em>.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> It could be
wished that these texts were more numerous and more precise, but they
support the supposition that some connexion existed between each legion
and a definite group of auxiliary regiments better than any evidence
previously adduced. The connexion, however, must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> been very slight
and easily broken. Dr. Hardy has pointed out that although three out
of the four legions stationed in Germania Superior in 70 left the
province for good during the following thirty-five years, there is
abundant evidence that nothing like the same proportion of the auxilia
stationed in the province accompanied them.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> It is also clear that,
in the second century at any rate, the number of auxilia attached to
any legion was not fixed in accordance with any general principle, but
depended upon the exigencies of the local situation on each frontier. A
reference to the list of provincial garrisons contained in the appendix
will show that whereas there are not likely to have been more than
three thousand auxilia apiece to each of the three legions of Pannonia
Superior, there were probably thirty thousand to be divided among the
three legions of Britain, while in Dacia there was only one legion with
something approaching twenty-five thousand auxilia. Still, with these
reservations, it seems possible enough that the auxilia were always
considered as in some sense dependent on the legions, and that where
several legions were stationed in the same province, an arrangement was
made dividing the auxilia into a corresponding number of groups, each
of which was for certain purposes attached to a particular legion.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p><em>Total number of the auxilia.</em> This section should naturally conclude
with some statement of the total number of auxilia in the imperial
service. Unfortunately, no clear and direct evidence can be obtained
on this point either from literary or epigraphical sources. Tacitus,
in his survey of the military resources of the Empire in the reign of
Tiberius, after enumerating the legions in detail, contents himself
with a vague sentence suggesting that the auxiliaries were as numerous
as the legionaries and Household Troops.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> This phrase is perhaps
accurate enough for the period to which he is referring, but it is
obviously not meant to be precise, and must certainly not be taken
to express any principle habitually followed in the composition of
the imperial army. If we endeavour to check the statement from other
sources we have the remark of Velleius that in 6, at the time of the
great Pannonian revolt, the ten legions concentrated under Tiberius’s
command were accompanied by 70 cohorts and 14 alae.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> If we allow
for a few regiments being <em>miliariae</em>, this would represent a little
over 50,000 men, a number about equivalent to that of the legionaries.
If we may assume a similar ratio in other provinces, the total for
the auxilia at this period would amount to 150,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> It must
be remembered, however, that at this date and throughout the whole
pre-Flavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> period the government relied upon the troops of the client
kingdoms and levies of border militia to supplement the imperial
troops. With the gradual elimination of these secondary forces,
which has already been described, the number of regular units was
proportionately increased. More than twenty regiments were raised in
the old kingdom of Thrace after its annexation in 46, and five alae
and nineteen cohorts are found in 69 garrisoning the two provinces
which had been formed from the kingdom of Mauretania.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> We need not,
then, be surprised if the figures supplied by Tacitus and Josephus show
that so early as 69 the number of the auxiliaries considerably exceeds
the figure suggested for the end of the reign of Augustus. According
to Josephus, Vespasian entered Judaea in 67 with at least 20,000
auxiliaries, which probably represents two-thirds of the total number
available in the Eastern provinces.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> In the Danubian provinces in
69 there were, according to Tacitus, sixteen alae.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> On the basis of
the information given in the diplomata, we can safely reckon that there
would be at least three cohorts to every ala, and that one regiment in
four would be <em>miliaria</em>. Some 40,000 auxiliaries, therefore, must have
been stationed in the Danubian provinces at this period. In the same
year Vitellius entered Rome with twelve alae and thirty-four cohorts,
that is to say some 30,000 men, which represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> probably two-thirds
of the auxilia in the Rhine armies and Raetia.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The garrison of the
two Mauretanias, to which allusion has already been made, would amount
to about 15,000 men. We thus arrive at the following totals for the
auxilia at this period:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="my" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="auxilia totals">

<td class="tdl">&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

<p>To this at least another 50,000 men must be added for the auxilia of
Britain, Spain, Africa, Noricum, and the small garrisons of the inland
provinces, making a grand total of 180,000 men. The next forty years
saw the figure mount even higher. The remaining client kingdoms in the
East, which were still strong enough to furnish 15,000 men for the
Jewish war in 67, were annexed, and the appearance of several new units
with the titles <em>Flavia</em> or <em>Ulpia</em> shows that more than this number of
regular auxilia was raised in their place.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Even Hadrian seems to
have made a few additions to the list, since his foreign policy, though
essentially pacific, was based upon a system of frontier defence to
which the auxilia <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>were more than ever essential.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> In Appendix I, where
the evidence as to the strength and distribution of the auxilia in
the second century is discussed in detail, it is suggested that by
the middle of the second century the force may have amounted to some
220,000 men, and that even this figure was probably exceeded sixty
years later.</p>

regiments are always present, and five more occur in four diplomata
out of the five. This makes it sufficiently clear that, on the theory
given above, the auxilia of the same legion must always be referred to,
particularly in view of the immobility of the frontier troops in the
second century (see below, <a href="#Page_114">pp. 114-16</a>), which forbids the supposition
that the same regiments would appear first attached to one legion,
then, after a few years’ interval, to another.</p></div>

of the reign of Gallienus which mentions <em>vexillationes legionum

out. It would be natural to suppose a system of military districts
within the province. In Britain, for instance, the line between Tyne
and Solway, with the auxilia upon it, might have been divided between
Legio VI Victrix from York and Legio XX Valeria Victrix from Chester.
Unfortunately the epigraphical evidence does not support the idea that
the activity of the two legions was localized in this way. The point is
obscure and would not have been worth such a detailed discussion but
for the unwarrantable facility with which it is usually disposed of.</p></div>

<span class="small">RECRUITING AND DISTRIBUTION</span></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> making a levy for the auxiliary regiments, the imperial government
was under no obligation to be at pains to legalize its position. In
an ancient state it was assumed, as a matter of course, that the
government had the power to call upon every citizen, if need arose, to
take his place in the fighting line. Even the privileged <em>cives Romani</em>
were never freed under the Empire from the legal obligation to military
service, however much they may have been spared in practice, so that
there can have been little doubt about the position of <em>peregrini</em>.
Only in the case of the <em>civitates foederatae</em> was the government
theoretically required to limit its demands to the number of men
stipulated in the original <em>foedus</em>.</p>

<p>So much for the position in theory; in practice, of course it was not
to the interests of the government to raise troops without considering
the susceptibilities of its subjects, more particularly since the
inhabitants of those districts which would furnish the best soldiers
would also prove the most dangerous rebels if the demands made upon
them exceeded their endurance. One instance of the conciliatory policy
followed by the early Empire has already been noted; the exemption of
the Batavians from all burdens but military service flattered their
pride and enlisted their clan-spirit effectually on the side of the
Romans. Evidence of a similar policy is apparent in the selection of
the ethnical titles borne by the majority of the auxiliary regiments.
In spite of the obvious convenience of such a step it was unusual for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
all the auxilia raised in one province to form a single series with
a uniform designation. Wherever the clan-spirit existed, the name of
the clan was accepted as the official title of the contingent which it
furnished to the imperial forces.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> In Tarraconensis, for example,
while the more civilized part of the province was represented by the
alae and cohortes Hispanorum, several of the wild tribes of the north
and west, such as the Aravaci, Vardulli, and Vascones gave their name
to the regiments which they supplied.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The Gallic levies reveal a
similar policy; while the contingents of the comparatively peaceful
Lugdunensis seem to be covered by the general title of Galli, a list
of the levies of Belgica contains the name of almost every tribe in
that warlike province.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> Indeed it is probable that during the first
years of the Empire many of these tribal contingents fought, like the
Batavians, as allies rather than as subjects of Rome, and knew little
of Roman training or discipline.</p>

<p>In the East the historic position of the great city-states of Syria
received similar recognition. Among the numerous regiments of archers
contributed by this province we can distinguish the contingents of
Ascalon, Tyre, Antioch, and Apamea, as well as corps from Chalcis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Damascus, Hemesa, and Samaria, who represented the incorporated armies
of the old client states.</p>

<p>The incidence of the levy upon different provinces can best be judged
by a statistical table giving the number of regiments raised in each.
This is not easy to construct owing to the confusion caused by the
duplication of numbering, and the consequent danger of counting the
same corps twice over, or of reckoning two corps as one. There were,
for example, in Pannonia two cohorts, each bearing the title ‘I
Alpinorum’, which can fortunately be distinguished from one another
because they are both mentioned in the same diploma, but there are
scores of similar cases which can only be decided as yet on a balance
of probabilities. This extremely inconvenient system seems to be due
to two causes. In the first place, when new regiments were raised some
time after the original levy they seem to have begun a fresh series
instead of being included in the old ones. This process can be followed
most clearly in the case of regiments raised after 70, which were
distinguished by a title derived from the name of the reigning emperor.
Thus we have cohorts I and II Flavia Brittonum, I Ulpia Brittonum,
I Aelia Brittonum, and I Aurelia Brittonum.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Secondly, it seems
probable that when newly-raised regiments were drafted into different
provinces they were numbered in a different series in each province.
This suggestion is supported by the fact that where a regiment bearing
a high number is found, it generally appears that the rest of the
series was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span> stationed in the same province, whereas isolated
cohorts generally have a low number. For example, the greater part of
the Gallic levies were originally stationed on the Rhine. Consequently,
we find few duplicate numbers and several series which run up to four
or even higher. The Thracian regiments, on the other hand, on account
of their special utility as archers, were distributed very widely
throughout the Empire during the first century, and of the twenty-seven
corps known to us, seventeen are numbered I or II, and are distributed
over eight provinces.</p>

<p>Apart from this difficulty the following list contains in any case more
regiments than ever existed at any one time. Fresh regiments must have
been raised to fill the gaps caused by such disasters as the defeat
of Varus and the rebellion of Boudicca, but in only a few cases can
we distinguish the earlier from the later levies. It is only possible
to put in a separate class those regiments which bear a title derived
from the Flavians or later emperors, and were probably raised after 70.
Still, if these limitations are borne in mind, the following table may
serve to show approximately the quota which each province contributed:</p>

<p>The first point to notice in this list is the smallness of the
contingent from the senatorial provinces. So small is it that Mommsen
desired to see here evidence of a constitutional principle.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The
auxilia were ‘gewissermassen eine Hausmacht des Kaisers’ and as such
raised only in the provinces governed by his <em>legati</em>. Such instances
as were then known of regiments raised in senatorial provinces were,
he thought, susceptible of explanation. The alae Vocontiorum, for
instance, represented a <em>civitas foederata</em> which was not, strictly
speaking, a part of the senatorial province of Narbonensis. It does
not, however, seem possible to maintain this theory. The Cohors I
Cretum<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> is a certain case of a regiment from a senatorial province,
nor can it be really doubted that contingents were also drawn from
Cyprus<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and Cyrene.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Indeed, it is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> to see what
legal or political obstacle should prevent Augustus and his successors
from utilizing the military material available in the senatorial
provinces. Even if Mommsen is right in believing that conscription,
as opposed to the enrolment of volunteers, could only take place in a
senatorial province with the authority of the Senate (and this theory
is questioned by both Gardthausen and Liebenam),<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> there is no
reason why levies should not have been made for the auxilia under these
conditions when they certainly were made for the legions.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> In no
case did any military power remain in the hands of the Senate, since
the recruits would immediately be marched away to garrison imperial
provinces. As a matter of fact, the reason for the smallness of the
senatorial contingent seems to have been a practical one. Few auxilia
were raised from Narbonensis and Baetica, because the greater part of
the inhabitants of these provinces had received the franchise and were
consequently eligible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> service in the legions. Achaia, Asia, and to
a certain extent Macedonia, were treated as being on the same footing,
partly because Greeks did actually serve in the Eastern legions, partly
because of the Philhellenic policy of the imperial government, which
would not deny to the Greek states, although they were technically
unenfranchised, the privileges enjoyed by the enfranchised urban
communities of the West. Also no doubt the Greek of the period was not
rated highly as a fighting man. On the other hand, from Cyrenaica,
Crete, Cyprus, parts of Macedonia, and Africa<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> useful troops could
be and were obtained. The way in which the system worked is shown by
the case of Noricum, which, although an imperial province, included
many enfranchised communities and contributed recruits to the Rhine
legions in the middle of the first century.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> Its contribution of
auxilia in consequence is limited to one ala and one cohort, as against
the eighteen regiments furnished by the neighbouring province of Raetia.</p>

<p>In contrast to Narbonensis, it was upon the remaining three Gallic
provinces that the levy fell most heavily. From this district came more
than a quarter of the auxiliary infantry<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> in the pre-Flavian period
and nearly half the cavalry. The Gallic troopers indeed maintained for
a century the reputation which they had won under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> Caesar’s command,
and Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> writing in the reign of Augustus, places them above
all other cavalry in the imperial army. Arrian,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> too, notes their
reputation and the number of Celtic words in the cavalry drill-book,
although in his day their position had been taken by the Pannonians,
already prominent in the campaign of 69.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Spain sent the largest
contingent after the Gallic provinces, and also contributed a few
words to the drill-book,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> but we hear nothing of the quality of
the Spanish troops and they soon lost their early importance. The
predominance of the auxilia of Spain and Gaul in the pre-Flavian period
is, however, a clear indication of the determination of Augustus to
base the Empire on its Western provinces. Archers alone, and these in
comparatively small numbers, were drawn from the East,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> which was
still regarded as the home of dangerous and un-Roman ideals.</p>

<p>Lastly, a word must be said about a group of regiments which do not
appear in the above lists and are too numerous to be passed over.
These are the cohorts which bear the titles <em>voluntariorum civium
Romanorum</em>, <em>ingenuorum c. R.</em>, <em>Italica c. R.</em>, and <em>campestris</em>.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
Collectively these regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> constitute the <em>cohortes civium
Romanorum</em> to the soldiers of which Augustus left by his will a
donative equal to that of the legionaries.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> From various passages
in the literary authorities it appears that they represent the
result of two levies made by Augustus in Italy, the first during the
Pannonian rising, and the second after the defeat of Varus.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> When
free-born citizens could not be found in sufficient numbers the levy
was extended to freedmen.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> This is corroborated by the evidence
of the inscriptions, since the title <em>ingenuorum</em> clearly implies the
existence of regiments whose members could not make this boast.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
Originally, as the provisions of the will of Augustus show, these
cohorts occupied a peculiar position, and were practically on a level
with the legionaries, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span> of which their commanders bear
the title of <em>tribunus</em>.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The presence, however, of the Cohors VIII
Voluntariorum on the Dalmatian diploma of 93 shows that unenfranchised
recruits had been accepted even during the pre-Flavian period, and in
the following century only their title distinguishes these regiments
from the ordinary auxilia.</p>

<p>The evidence hitherto considered has mainly served to illustrate
the original distribution of the burden of military service and the
respective quotas furnished by the different provinces to the auxilia
at the time of their organization. To trace the further workings of
this system it is necessary to examine the principles on which the
auxiliary regiments were distributed among the military areas and
to trace the relations between this distribution and the method of
recruiting.</p>

<p>A casual glance at the military diplomata, which give a fair idea of
the composition of the more important provincial garrisons between
the reign of Vespasian and that of Commodus, suggests that it was the
settled policy of the imperial government to destroy the possibility
of national cohesion and local sympathies among the regiments raised
from their subjects by distributing the contingents of each recruiting
district over as wide an area as possible, and making every frontier
army corps a mosaic of different nationalities. It will be shown
later that this theory, which has been frequently adopted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> modern
writers, will not stand before a closer scrutiny of the evidence as an
explanation of the state of things existing in the second century; it
can also be shown that such a principle of distribution was not the
original policy inaugurated by Augustus.</p>

<p>Our earliest evidence relates to the composition of the garrison of
the Danubian provinces, and the account of the great rising which took
place here in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 6 by the contemporary observer
Velleius makes it clear that the strength of the rebels lay in the
training which many had received in the Roman army. His reference to
the military knowledge of the leaders and the discipline of the rank
and file indicates that regular auxiliary regiments, raised locally
and stationed near their homes, had mutinied in sympathy with their
fellow tribesmen.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Concerning the state of things on the Rhine
frontier we have more detailed information which points to the same
conclusion. The account in the <cite>Annals</cite> of the campaigns of Germanicus
mentions cohorts of Raeti, Vindelici, and Gauls in addition to the
<em>tumultuariae catervae</em> of the local militia.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Later in the century
we find an Ala Treverorum engaged in putting down a revolt of their own
countrymen in 21,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> an Ala Canninefatium engaged in the disastrous
expedition of L. Apronius against the Frisii in 28,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and Vangiones
and Nemetes helping to repulse a raid of the Chatti in 50.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
Finally, when we turn to the narrative contained in the <cite>Histories</cite>
of the events of the disastrous year 69, we find abundant evidence
that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> this date three-fourths of the Rhenish auxilia were drawn
from Gaul proper or the Teutonic tribes of Belgica. The only regiments
mentioned by Tacitus which are not of local origin are (1) Thracians,
who appear on every frontier owing to their special qualifications as
archers;<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> (2) Spaniards, who may have entered the province in 43
with Legio IV Macedonica, which was transferred from Spain to the Rhine
to replace the troops sent to Britain, and (3) Britons, who probably
began to arrive from the newly conquered areas a few years later.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
Epigraphical evidence adds to the list a few regiments from the
Danubian provinces and some corps of oriental archers.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>In other provinces the same policy can be traced, although the evidence
is less abundant. In Africa, for example, the deserter Tacfarinas seems
to have served in his own province,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> and in Palestine we find
Samaritan regiments garrisoning Caesarea.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> On the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> there is
sufficient evidence to show that although each of the great frontier
armies contained imported elements, in particular the ubiquitous
Thracian and oriental archers, the original policy of the imperial
government was to draw the auxilia in each case from the nearest
recruiting-areas.</p>

<p>Both the advantages and the defects of this system are sufficiently
obvious. It saved trouble, a reason which had already commended it to
the administrators of the Republic, and it avoided the dangerous and
widespread discontent which, as the case of the Thracians shows, would
have followed any wholesale attempt to remove the newly organized
regiments to distant provinces.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Lastly, the men would be fighting
on ground which they knew against an enemy with whose methods of
fighting they would already be acquainted. On the other hand, there
was of course the obvious danger that in a border war which assumed
the character of a national struggle the local auxilia might desert to
their own countrymen and use the training which they had acquired in
the Roman service to increase the strength of the hostile resistance.
As a set-off to this danger the Romans reckoned with some justice
that tribal enmity was usually stronger than national feeling, and
in fact there were many tribal chiefs like Flavus, the brother of
Arminius, who were well content with the rewards and distinctions
which recompensed their fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Events, however, made it clear
that this confidence was misplaced. A time was to come when the border
tribes would identify themselves readily with the cause of imperial
defence, but the influences which were to bring about this result were
often slow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> their operation, and the first century saw on almost
every frontier a more or less serious outbreak of national feeling,
in which the auxilia often participated. Yet even the most serious of
these revolts, that of Civilis in 69, showed how the new leaven was
working. The political conceptions of the mutineers were borrowed from
their conquerors, not from their ancestors, and in the darkest hour of
the revolt a Gallic cavalry regiment, the Ala Picentiana, was the first
to return to its fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>The first district in which the Augustan policy broke down was the
Danubian provinces, and a glance at the names of the regiments
stationed here in the pre-Flavian period shows that the lesson of the
great rebellion was not thrown away upon the imperial authorities.
In Pannonia a diploma of the year 60<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> shows us the following
seven cohorts, I and II Alpinorum, I Asturum et Callaecorum, I and II
Hispanorum, I Lusitanorum, and V Lucensium et Callaecorum, forming part
of the garrison of the province, and we may add the Ala Aravacorum
on the strength of an early inscription.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> In Dalmatia early
inscriptions give the following cohorts:</p>

<p>I Campanorum Voluntariorum civium Romanorum. iii. 8438.</p>

<p>VIII Voluntariorum civium Romanorum. iii. 1742.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>III Alpinorum. iii. 8491, 8495, 14632.</p>

<p>I Lucensium. iii. 8486, 8492, 8494, 9834. All these must date before
80, when the regiment appears in Pannonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>This list might perhaps be lengthened, but it is sufficient for our
purpose. It is clear that after the rebellion Augustus imported
into the disturbed area a number of regiments from other provinces,
particularly from Spain, where the large garrison maintained during
the earlier part of his reign could now safely be reduced. The
Pannonian and Dalmatian regiments, on the other hand, were transferred
elsewhere&mdash;several of them, as we have seen, to the Rhine, where they
served to replace the troops who shared the fate of the legions of
Varus.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>The same sequence of events took place on the Rhine in the years 69 and
70. The temporary success of Civilis was largely due to the wholesale
defection to his standard of the Gallic and Teutonic regiments then
stationed on the Rhine frontier. After the suppression of the rebellion
in the summer of 70 a number of these regiments were disbanded or
sent elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> and their place was taken by the auxilia who had
accompanied the new legions sent into the province by Vespasian. Of the
29 regiments which appear in the Rhine in the second century only 11
bear titles indicating a local origin, and some of these had probably
not belonged to the pre-Flavian garrison but had only returned to their
native country in 70 after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span> a long stay in other provinces. It has
been noticed, for example, that of the two veterans of the Cohors I
Aquitanorum, to whom the diplomata of 82 (D. xiv) and 90 (D. xxi) were
granted, one is a Thracian, the other a Galatian; further, that one of
these diplomata was found near the site of the later town of Nicopolis
ad Istrum, where the owner had presumably settled after his discharge.
This suggests that the regiment had been stationed in Moesia and only
returned to its native province in 70 with the Moesian legion VIII
Augusta.</p>

<p>It is on these two frontiers, the Rhine and the Danube, that the
transfer of troops can most easily be traced, because of the importance
of the military events which caused it to take place. In other parts
of the Empire other tendencies were at work during the first century
which produced the same result in less noticeable fashion. One need
only mention the steady drift of troops from the Danube to the East
in the reign of Nero,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> and from the Rhine to the Danube a little
later,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> and it is easily intelligible that the second-century army
list shows few traces of the original policy of Augustus.</p>

<p>If, then, it were correct to assume that the title of an auxiliary
regiment is always a correct index of its composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span> it would
certainly be justifiable to comment on the extraordinary mixture
of nationalities in the frontier garrisons of the second century.
Fortunately, however, the frequent mention of the origin of individual
soldiers on diplomata and sepulchral inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> gives us the
means of checking this assumption and of working upon a surer basis
of fact. The following lists give the inscriptions of this type from
Pannonia arranged in two groups according to their date, the year
70 being taken as the dividing line; that is to say, the soldiers
mentioned in the first group were <em>enrolled</em> before that date.
Some inscriptions which could not be dated with any certainty have
necessarily been omitted, also others where there was reason to believe
that the soldier mentioned was enrolled when his regiment was in a
different province.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> To the second group, which illustrates the
recruiting system from the Flavian period onwards, a list of similar
inscriptions from Dacia has been added. In each case the title of the
regiment is followed by the nationality or place of origin of the
soldier, stated in the form given on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> the inscription, and by the name
of the province from which he was drawn. For reasons which will appear
later the evidence concerning the oriental regiments is omitted.</p>

<p>The facts disclosed by these inscriptions are very significant. In the
first list, as is natural, we find traces of the troops transferred
into Pannonia from other provinces after the great rebellion. It is
more important, however, to notice that before the end of the reign
of Tiberius natives of the province were already being accepted for
service in these imported regiments.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> In fact there is nothing here
to suggest that any attempt was made to preserve the national character
of these Spanish and Alpine corps by obtaining fresh drafts from the
districts in which they were originally raised. Those recruits who do
not come from Pannonia itself are drawn merely from the neighbouring
provinces of Dalmatia and Thrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>But it would perhaps be misleading to infer from this evidence alone
that local recruiting was universally adopted in the first century,
although it was certainly common. It is possible that in the Flavian
period, when the memory of the rebellion of Civilis was still fresh,
some attempt was made to check a national cohesion by combining drafts
from different provinces in the same regiment. This at least is
suggested by the nationalities of twenty-one soldiers of an auxiliary
regiment which are recorded on a sepulchral inscription at Tropaeum
Traiani in Moesia Inferior.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> This monument was erected in memory
of men killed in action during one of the Dacian campaigns either of
Domitian or Trajan, so that its evidence applies to the recruiting of
the Flavian period. Twelve of these men came from the Lower Rhine, two
from Lugdunensis, and three from Spain, while Raetia, Noricum, Britain,
and Africa supply one each.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> In Pannonia, too, some Spanish
soldiers appear rather mysteriously in an Ala Pannoniorum on two
inscriptions which can hardly be later than the beginning of the second
century.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> There are even traces of a similar policy having been
pursued in the recruiting for the legions during the same period. In a
list of seventy-six soldiers who were apparently enrolled in Legio III
Augusta towards the end of the first century, we find men from seven
different provinces.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> In any case, however, no attempt seems to
have been made to preserve any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> connexion between an auxiliary regiment
and the tribe from which its title was derived.</p>

<p>When we come to the second century there is no more room for doubt;
for all cohorts and alae on the Pannonian frontier, leaving out of
account, as before, the oriental regiments, local recruiting has become
practically universal. Seventy per cent. of the recruits come from the
two Pannonian provinces, the majority from the Azali and the Eravisci,
tribes which never gave their name to an auxiliary regiment. Even
the Thracian regiments, which might have maintained their original
character without much difficulty, form no exception to the rule. In
Dacia the exceptionally large auxiliary garrison<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> could not be
supported entirely by local levies, but the deficiency was mostly made
up in the nearest available recruiting-grounds of Moesia and Thrace.</p>

<p>A few examples may be adduced from other provinces to show that the
methods employed on the Danube frontier were not exceptional. In
Germania Superior three soldiers of the Alae I and II Flaviae Geminae
describe themselves as Baetasius, Elvetius, and Secuanus, and the
Raetian diploma of the year 107 was granted to a Boian who had served
in the Ala I Hispanorum Auriana.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> In Africa a soldier of the
Cohors VII Lusitanorum gives ‘castris’ as his place of origin, as do
the majority of the veterans discharged during the second century from
the African legion III Augusta.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Concerning the Eastern provinces
we have very little evidence, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> it may be noted that of the large
number of regiments raised by Trajan in this part of the Empire the
majority remained stationed in the East throughout the following
century, and there is no reason to suppose that they were not kept up
by local levies.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>The recruiting of the legions during the second century seems to have
followed the same lines. The high proportion of men of Legio III
Augusta in Africa who give ‘castris’ as their birthplace has already
been noted. Similarly of 39 soldiers discharged from Legio II Traiana
at Alexandria in 194, 22 come from the ‘castra’, 8 from the Greek
towns in Egypt, and only 9 were not born in the province.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Of
133 soldiers discharged in the following year from Legio VII Claudia
stationed at Viminacium, 104 come from Upper or Lower Moesia, and
of the remainder all but one come from the Danubian provinces.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>
Further evidence on the recruiting-area of the auxilia during this
period can be obtained from another source, the inscriptions of the
Equites Singulares Imperatoris. This corps, which seems to have been
raised towards the end of the first century, possibly by Domitian,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
formed thenceforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> a part of the imperial guard, and was stationed
at Rome. It was recruited mainly from the same area as the auxiliary
alae, and a certain number of the men were selected from them.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> On
a hundred epitaphs of members of this corps who recorded their place of
origin, the provinces are represented in the following proportions:<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>The list shows that this <em>corps d’&eacute;lite</em> was not representative of
all the cavalry of the Empire; the proportion of orientals is far too
low. It was still upon the Western provinces that the emperors of the
second century relied, and from these, therefore, that the guard was
recruited. As regards these provinces, the composition of the Equites
Singulares reflects fairly accurately the relative importance of each
as a recruiting-ground for the auxiliary cavalry of this period, and
the change which has taken place in the military situation since the
days of Augustus is at once apparent. The Galli<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> and Hispani, who
were then the flower of the imperial cavalry, and continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> to give
their names to nearly half the cavalry regiments in the service, have
entirely vanished. Speaking generally, in fact, the inland provinces
no longer contribute, and the recruiting-areas have contracted to the
purely frontier districts. The relative importance of these, too, has
altered since the beginning of the first century. The tribes on the
Lower Rhine are still well represented, but the contingent of the
German provinces is entirely surpassed by that of Pannonia. If we
assume that the honour of serving in the Guards was bestowed upon the
natives of each province in proportion to the size of the contingent
which they supplied to the cavalry of the line, this increased
importance of the Pannonians follows naturally upon the universal
adoption of local recruiting for the frontier armies; since not only
had the balance of military power now definitely shifted from the Rhine
to the Danube,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> but local conditions required an exceptionally high
proportion of mounted men.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>The preceding survey of the evidence has purposely omitted that
dealing with the oriental regiments, which seemed, on account of its
exceptional character, to merit a special discussion. In Pannonia
and Dacia we find three such regiments, the Ala I Augusta Ituraeorum
and the Cohors I Hemesenorum in Pannonia Inferior, and the Cohors I
Augusta Ituraeorum, stationed in Pannonia during the first century, and
transferred to Dacia at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span> time of the creation of the province.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>
Thanks to the recent work of Hungarian archaeologists, the second
of these corps, the Cohors I Hemesenorum Miliaria Equitata Civium
Romanorum Sagittariorum, to give it its full title, is perhaps better
known to us than any other auxiliary regiment.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Probably enrolled
in the Roman army at the beginning of the second century, at the time
of the annexation of the small client kingdom from which its name
was derived, this regiment had been transferred to Pannonia by the
beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius, and certainly remained in the
province until 240.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Throughout this period it seems to have been
stationed at Intercisa, where upwards of fifty inscriptions, chiefly
sepulchral, have now been discovered, the majority of the latter
belonging, as the frequent use of the name Aurelius shows, to the end
of the second and the beginning of the third century. Of the five
soldiers whose birthplace is mentioned on their tombstones, three came
from Hemesa itself, one from Samosata, and one from Arethusa,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> and
the owner of a diploma which dates from between 138 and 146 came from
Syria.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> It is clear, then, that during its whole stay in Pannonia
this regiment was not recruited, like the majority of the auxilia,
from the neighbouring district, but was constantly in receipt of fresh
drafts from the province in which it was originally raised. As further
proof of the tenacity with which this connexion was maintained, we
find that at the end of the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> Severus the soldiers dedicated
a temple to their <em>deus patrius</em> Sol Aelagabalus.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> An examination
of the evidence dealing with the other oriental regiments leads to
the same result. Soldiers discharged in 98 and 110 from the Cohors
I Augusta Ituraeorum and the Ala of the same name, give Cyrrhus in
Syria and Ituraea as their places of origin, and another Ituraean
is mentioned on a sepulchral inscription of the latter regiment in
Pannonia.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Oriental regiments, and in particular oriental archers,
appear also on other provinces<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>, and although there is a lack of
dated evidence we can hardly doubt that a rule which was maintained
along the whole Danube frontier also held good elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>The reason for the adoption of these exceptional methods in the
recruiting of the oriental auxilia was probably the purely military one
that good archers were born in Syria, and could not be made elsewhere,
but the consequent presence in every frontier army of an oriental
element, holding firmly to its own customs and religious beliefs, was
a fact of more than military significance. In particular it must be
remembered that the enfranchised children of these oriental auxiliaries
were qualified and readily accepted for service in the legions. In the
inscriptions of the Cohors I Hemesenorum we have abundant evidence
of this process, which gave oriental ideas an opportunity for wider
penetration.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>The British regiments, too, show a tendency to keep up national
recruiting, although the evidence on this point is still scanty.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>
In this case the explanation is probably to be found in the intractable
nature of the tribes of North Britain, which made it appear undesirable
to use the contingents which they supplied near at home. Certainly
all the British regiments seem to have been sent abroad, and only one
soldier of British origin is found in the province.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> It would
appear, in fact, that the army of Britain was maintained largely
by drafts from the Rhine area, but the evidence at present is an
insufficient basis for any general conclusions. In Dacia, too, as
was natural, the auxilia raised immediately after the conquest were
transferred elsewhere. Here, however, there does not seem to have been
the same objection to local recruiting for the troops stationed in the
province, and the practice was certainly, as has been shown, in force
during the second century.</p>

<h4><em>The Numeri.</em></h4>

<p>It is clear, then, that in the second century the cohorts and alae of
the Augustan system, with certain definite and limited exceptions, were
recruited locally from the provinces in which they were stationed,
without any general attempt to justify the ethnical titles which they
still bore. At the same moment, however, as this principle seems
definitely established, there begin to appear on inscriptions certain
regiments of a new type which stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span> outside the prevailing system.
These regiments are given the name <em>numerus</em>, which does not seem to
have had any very precise meaning, and for which it is difficult to
find an English equivalent. They also bore tribal titles, a list of
which is given below, together with the names of the provinces in which
<em>numeri</em> of each tribe occur.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<p><em>Brittones.</em> At least ten <em>numeri</em> in Germania Superior. The earliest
inscriptions date from the reign of Pius, and the theory is generally
accepted that these Brittones were newly conquered tribesmen from the
district lying between the two frontier walls, deported after the
campaigns of Lollius Urbicus. These <em>numeri</em> also bear secondary titles
derived from the names of the districts in which they were stationed,
e.g. Murrenses, clearly connected with the river Murr.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p><em>Germani.</em> Dacia.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<p><em>Palmyreni.</em> Africa,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> Dacia,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> and probably Britain.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<p><em>Mauri.</em> Dacia (as a vexillatio from Mauretania Caesariensis).<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
Frequently also in the two Mauretanias.</p>

<p><em>Raeti Gaesati</em> (i.e. Raetians armed with the <em>gaesum</em>, a kind of
heavy spear). Britain.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p><em>Syri.</em> Dacia,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Mauretania,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Moesia Inferior,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> and possibly
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>The titles show that these <em>numeri</em> are closely connected with the five
<em>nationes</em>, Cantabri, Gaesati,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> Palmyreni, Daci, and Brittones, who
form part of the army described by Hyginus, and are distinguished from
the cohorts and alae of the regular auxilia. In fact the term <em>numerus</em>
is not invariably found on inscriptions, and for a corps which simply
described itself as ‘Syri sagittarii,’<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> <em>natio</em> may easily have
seemed a convenient term. It is also clear from Hyginus that what
distinguished the <em>numeri</em> from the older formations was their looser
organization and more barbarous character, and their titles show that
they were drawn from the outermost borders of the Empire, or the most
uncivilized districts within it.</p>

<p>Evidence about the character of these troops is scanty; being the
least civilized part of the army they were not very prone to indulge
in inscriptions. We do not even know the size of a <em>numerus</em>,
or, indeed, if these regiments had any definite size at all. The
<em>nationes</em> of Hyginus range from 500 to 900,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> but the low rank of
the <em>praepositus numeri</em> below the <em>praefectus cohortis</em>,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> and
the smallness of the accommodation arranged for these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> regiments in
German forts, suggest 200 to 300 as a more probable figure. Smaller
they can hardly have been, since they are divided into centuries and
<em>turmae</em>.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>As regards recruiting, the Palmyrenes, at any rate, obtained fresh
drafts, not from the province in which they were stationed, but from
their native home. The numerus Palmyrenorum, which was stationed at
El-Kantara in Africa, has left inscriptions covering the whole period
from the middle of the second to the middle of the third century, which
show clearly what pains were taken to preserve the original character
of the regiment.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> Similar inscriptions of a numerus Palmyrenorum
in Dacia give evidence of the same principle.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> Unfortunately, we
cannot tell whether this was the case with all the <em>numeri</em>, or whether
the Palmyreni occupied in this respect the same peculiar position as
the oriental regiments among the regular auxilia.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>But whatever the later practice, the original intention of the imperial
government in raising this new class of troops seems to be clear. The
local recruiting of the regular auxilia presupposes a rapid progress of
‘Romanization’ among the provincials and the disappearance of all such
national feeling as had caused the mutiny of the German and Pannonian
auxilia in the first century. From the military point of view,
however, this advance in culture, although it facilitated the raising
of recruits, was by no means an unmixed blessing. The old levies of
wild tribesmen, schooled by centuries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> local warfare, who strove to
preserve in the Roman service their local reputation, had qualities
which were lacking to the regiments of civilized Latin-speaking
provincials, in which national methods of fighting<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> had been
replaced by a uniform training and clan feeling by <em>esprit de corps</em>.
It was to provide a leaven of the old spirit that the <em>numeri</em> were
raised from the wildest of the border tribes, and not only encouraged
to fight after the manner of their fathers, but even permitted to
continue the use of their native tongues.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>The first experiment of this kind was made by Trajan, when he brought
over Lusius Quietus and his <em>Mauri gentiles</em> for the Dacian war,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>
but it was probably Hadrian who made the <em>numeri</em> a regular part of
the military system. It is in his reign that they first appear on
inscriptions, and it is to the <em>numeri</em> that we must refer the passage
in Arrian’s <cite>Tactica</cite>, in which the emperor is praised for encouraging
his troops to keep up their national methods of fighting, and even
their national war-cries.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The tribes to whom he refers are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">
Κελτοί</span> (by which Germans are probably meant),<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> Dacians, and
Raetians. For the first and third there is epigraphical evidence, and
the last two appear also among the <em>nationes</em> of Hyginus. It appears,
then, that Hadrian was not, as is sometimes stated, the originator
of the system of local recruiting; rather he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span> found it already in
existence, and sought to correct its defects by utilizing again in the
service of the Empire the clan spirit of uncivilized tribes, which had
often proved so useful in the past.</p>

<h4><em>The Praefecti.</em></h4>

<p>The previous discussion of the methods by which the auxilia were
recruited has dealt only with the private soldiers, and, as a natural
corollary, with such officers as were promoted from the ranks. To
the position of <em>praefectus</em>, however, the private soldier could
not normally aspire, and he attained it, if at all, only under
exceptionally favourable circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Normally, the commanding
officers of the auxiliary regiments were drawn from an entirely
different social stratum to the men, and although the method of their
appointment varied and the area from which they were drawn shifted
its boundaries at different periods, these changes did not follow the
same lines as those which we have been tracing in connexion with the
recruiting of the rank and file.</p>

<p>The auxiliary commands are familiar to all students of the Roman Empire
from inscriptions of men who went through the equestrian career,
the first stage of which was formed by the posts of <em>praefectus
cohortis</em>, <em>tribunus legionis</em>, and <em>praefectus alae</em>. It has, however,
been pointed out by von Domaszewski<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> that this system was not
established until the middle of the first century. Under Augustus
and Tiberius, not only was the relative rank of these posts still
undetermined, but they were filled in many cases not by young men
beginning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span> equestrian <em>cursus</em>, but by veteran centurions from the
legions, especially the <em>primipili</em>. We have noticed this system in the
army of Caesar, so that here, as elsewhere, Augustus was continuing a
republican practice. The following inscriptions,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> which are both of
early date, give typical careers of this character.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hangingindent22">1. C.&nbsp;Pompullius C.&nbsp;f. Hor(atia) prim(us) pil(us), trib(unus)
mil(itum), praef(ectus) eq(uitum).</p>

<p class="hangingindent22">2. M. Vergilio M. f. Ter(etina) Gallo Lusio prim(o) pil(o) leg(ionis)
XI, praef(ecto) coh(ortis) Ubiorum peditum et equitum, donato hastis
puris duabus et coronis aureis ab Divo Augusto et Ti: Caesare Augusto,
&amp;c.</p></div>

<p>This system is heartily commended by von Domaszewski, on the ground
that the auxilia were thus commanded by more skilful officers, and
were more under Roman (i.e. Italian) control than was the case in the
second century.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> The assertion, however, seems far too sweeping,
since by no means all the auxiliary regiments were commanded by men
of this class; there were, on the contrary, many <em>praefecti</em> at
this period who came neither from Italy nor even the more Romanized
provinces. The <cite>Histories</cite> of Tacitus show clearly that at the end of
the pre-Flavian period a number of auxiliary regiments, particularly
those drawn from the more independent border tribes, were commanded
by their own chiefs. This practice had not sprung up during the reign
of Nero, but was a natural consequence of the development of these
corps from contingents supplied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span> states nominally ‘in alliance’
with Rome.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The eight Batavian cohorts who play such an important
r&ocirc;le in the rebellion of 69 were so commanded,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> as well as an
ala of the same tribe.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> Iulius Civilis himself was a <em>praefectus
cohortis</em>,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> and two Treveri, Alpinius Montanus and Iulius
Classicus, commanded a cohort and ala respectively.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> All these
officers, as their names show, had doubtless received the franchise,
but they were employed in their capacity as tribal chiefs, not as
Roman citizens, and are to be distinguished from the <em>praefecti</em>, who
were drawn at this period from the Romanized districts of Spain and
from Gallia Narbonensis. It is chiefly as commanders of cohorts that
officers of this type appear, since many of the alae dated back, as we
have seen, to the period of the civil wars, and had long lost their
original character as tribal regiments. This explains the fact that
among Italian officers of this period, the title <em>praefectus alae</em>
or <em>praefectus equitum</em> appears far more frequently than <em>praefectus
cohortis</em>, although the cohorts were of course more numerous than the
alae.</p>

<p>During the first half of the first century, therefore, we have a system
which differs widely from that revealed by the equestrian <em>cursus
honorum</em>. The establishment of the equestrian monopoly of the auxiliary
commands was, in fact, only completed by a series of reforms carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
out during the period which began with the administrative activity of
Claudius, and ended with the reorganization of the army by Vespasian
after the disastrous Civil War of 69.</p>

<p>The first of these changes was that the <em>praefecti</em> ceased to be drawn
as before from among the veteran centurions of the legions. Early in
the reign of Claudius the post of <em>praefectus alae</em> disappeared from
the career of the <em>primipili</em>, who were promoted henceforward to the
tribunate of one of the cohorts of Household Troops at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
Centurions of lower rank were still advanced to the command of cohorts
both in this and the succeeding periods, but such cases are very
rare.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> A trace of the old connexion between the legionary officers
and the <em>militia equestris</em> still survives, however, in the regular use
of a centurion as <em>praepositus cohortis</em>&mdash;that is to say, as temporary
commander in case of the death or absence of a <em>praefectus</em>.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> The
<em>numeri</em>, too, were often placed in charge of an ex-centurion bearing
this title, an arrangement which was probably called for by the
intractable character of these barbarian irregulars.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>The employment of tribal chiefs as <em>praefecti</em> also became less
frequent, as the auxiliary regiments, transferred from one province to
another, and recruited from different nationalities, gradually lost
their original character. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> mutinous officers of the Rhine army, who
were doubtless cashiered by Vespasian, were probably the last examples
of <em>praefecti</em> drawn from this class.</p>

<p>Lastly, the respective rank of the different posts in the <em>militia
equestris</em> was finally determined; and the order <em>praefectus
cohortis</em>&mdash;<em>tribunus legionis</em>&mdash;<em>praefectus alae</em> is hardly ever varied
after 70, except that the tribunate of a <em>cohors miliaria</em> sometimes
appears in the second place.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>The result of these changes was that henceforward the auxiliary
officers were practically all of one type, men of equestrian rank
entering upon what was now the accustomed <em>cursus honorum</em> of their
class. That this system was not universally adopted at an earlier date
is not surprising. The equestrian <em>praefecti</em> were young men directly
appointed by the emperor, without any previous military training;
before the auxilia could be entrusted to their charge a certain advance
in civilization and tractability had to be made by the provincials,
and the veteran centurions and tribal chiefs of the Augustan system
were more fitted to deal with the men who composed the auxiliary
levies during the first hundred years of the Empire. As it was, these
regiments contained in the second century far fewer representatives
of the governing class than the native corps in our own Indian army.
With the exception of the <em>praefectus</em>, who himself was not necessarily
an Italian, the officers&mdash;that is, the centurions and decurions&mdash;were
practically all, as we have seen, promoted from the ranks. But to the
Roman Empire, in which rulers and ruled, never separated by any deep
racial or religious gulf, were gradually made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> closer akin by the bond
of a common civilization, our rule in India affords in this respect no
real parallel.</p>

<p>The majority of these <em>praefecti</em> were, at the beginning of this
period, of Italian origin, taken from the leading families of the
country towns, the class which formed, under the rule of the Flavian
emperors who were themselves sprung from it, the backbone of the
Roman bureaucracy. The Romanization of the Western provinces led to
an increasing proportion of men from the provincial <em>municipia</em> being
admitted into the imperial service, but until the reign of Marcus the
Italian element still predominated. The <em>praefecti</em> mentioned on five
diplomata from Pannonia Superior and two from Dacia dated 133, 138,
136-46, 148, 149, 157, and 145-61 were natives of Sassina, Bovianum,
Faventia, Suessa, Rome, Hispellum, and Picenum.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>The accession of Septimius Severus possibly accelerated the speed at
which the provincial element was increasing, but there is not, as has
been suggested by von Domaszewski, any sign of a violent and wholesale
exclusion of Italians from this branch of the service. This point may
be illustrated by the following inscriptions of Italian <em>praefecti</em>,
which can be dated after 193:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hangingindent22">VIII 9359. Caesarea. M. Popilius Nepos domo Roma, a <em>praefectus</em> of the
Ala Gemina Sebastenorum in Mauretania Caesariensis. The inscription
honours a procurator who is dated by Cagnat to 201-9.</p>

<p class="hangingindent22"><cite>A. E.</cite> 1908. 206. Puteoli. T. Caesius Anthianus, a native of this
town, was <em>praefectus</em> of the Cohors II Augusta Thracum at the
beginning of the third century.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest provincial <em>praefecti</em> came from the thoroughly Romanized
districts of Spain and Gallia Narbonensis, natives of which appear even
in the pre-Flavian period. These were followed in the course of the
second century by representatives of nearly all the Western provinces;
Africa in particular sent <em>praefecti</em> from its many flourishing towns
to almost every frontier during the latter half of the second century,
and the accession of the African Septimius Severus at its close
possibly gave his fellow countrymen a specially favoured position in
the succeeding period.</p>

<p>Only in Britain and Gallia Lugdunensis do the Celtic chiefs seem to
have made no attempt to maintain in the second century the military
position held by their fathers in the first. It is hardly likely that
their absence from the lists of <em>praefecti</em><a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> is due to deliberate
exclusion on the part of the imperial government. It was more probably
a voluntary abstinence, due largely to the fact that these military
commands were now regarded merely as an introduction to the civil
service, not as a career in themselves. The Celtic nobles were not
uninfluenced by the tendencies of the age. But although they might
speak and read Latin with ease, decorate their homes with the material
products of Roman civilization, and employ Greek rhetoricians to tutor
their children, these country gentlemen living in the midst of their
estates preserved a very different outlook to that of the leading
townsmen of the municipalities of Africa or even Narbonensis. The Celt
retained his martial qualities down to the last days of the Empire in
the West, but seems to have found little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> that was congenial to him in
the prospect of forming part of that great administrative machine, in
the perfection of which almost every other province in the Empire took
its share.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>The Eastern provinces of the Empire occupy, as usual, a somewhat
exceptional position. As in the West, these provinces began to
contribute <em>praefecti</em> in some numbers towards the end of the
first century. A certain C.&nbsp;Julius Demosthenes of Oinoanda went
through the ‘<em>militia equestris</em>’ in the reign of Trajan, and his
son, Julius Antonius, followed in his footsteps in the succeeding
generation.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> To a citizen of Caria, L. Aburnius of Alabanda,
probably, as his name shows, the descendant of one of the families
of veterans settled by Augustus in the south of Asia Minor,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a>
the wars of Trajan presented opportunity for a military career of
considerable variety and distinction. This officer was successively
<em>praefectus fabrum</em>, <em>tribunus legionis III Augustae</em>, <em>praefectus
cohortis III Augustae Thracum equitatae</em>, <em>praefectus cohortis III
Thracum Syriacae equitatae</em>, <em>praepositus</em><a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> <em>cohortis I Ulpiae
Petraeorum</em>, <em>praepositus annonae</em><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> on the Euphrates
during the Parthian War, <em>tribunus legionis VI Ferratae</em>, during his
tenure of which post he was decorated by Trajan, and <em>praefectus alae
I Ulpiae singularium</em>.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> These cases are not isolated, and it is
clear that a military career was open to the Greeks and the more or
less Hellenized orientals who constituted the equestrian class in
the Eastern provinces. But while the <em>praefecti</em> from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> Western
provinces were sent indiscriminately to every frontier, the majority
of those drawn from the East seem, during the first two centuries, to
have been confined to service with the Eastern commands. Aburnius,
for example, only left the East once for service with the Legio III
Augusta in Africa, and his son’s career seems to have been similarly
localized.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> We should perhaps add Moesia Inferior to the list of
provinces in which Eastern <em>praefecti</em> appear frequently during the
second century, since those mentioned on the diplomata for 134 and
138 came from Palmyra and Side respectively.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> But Moesia Inferior
was reckoned in other respects as coming within the Hellenic sphere
of influence. These restrictions are probably due to the low estimate
which was placed throughout the first two centuries on the military
qualities of Greeks and orientals, in spite of the value of the latter
as archers.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> But we may also see evidence of the unbridgeable gulf
which still existed between the two halves of the Empire, and of the
reluctance of the Hellene to embark upon a career in what he considered
to be the barbarous provinces of the West. It is only with the advent
of the semi-orientalized dynasty of the Severi that <em>praefecti</em> drawn
from the Eastern provinces appear in any numbers on the Western
frontiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>In all this the course of events is what one would naturally expect.
The spread of uniform culture throughout the Western provinces of the
Empire, the prosperity of the ubiquitous municipalities which were
its material expression, and the general extension of the franchise
which accompanied this development, involved a steady increase in the
class qualified and eager for the equestrian career. The admission
of these provincial <em>equites</em> to the posts for which they were
qualified followed automatically without special encouragement from any
particular emperor,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> and the diverse origins of the <em>praefecti</em> at
the beginning of the third century are one of the best proofs that can
be adduced of the prosperity and civilization of the provinces at this
period. It is impossible to follow von Domaszewski in concluding from
the evidence that at this date the inhabitants of Italy and the more
civilized areas in the provinces were deliberately excluded from the
<em>militia equestris</em>, and that the auxiliary regiments were given into
the hands of barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> The army was indeed beginning to suffer
from the introduction of a barbarian element, but it is not among the
officers of the auxilia that this element is most noticeable. The
following list of <em>praefecti</em>, who can be dated to the first half of
the third century, does not bear out the accusation:</p>

<p>vii. 344. Britain.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Aemilius Crispinus natus in provincia Africa de
Tusdro (dated 242).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>viii. 2766. Britain. P. Furius Rusticus. Lambaesis. Severus or later.
Britannia Inferior is mentioned.</p>

<p>xiii. 6658. Germania Superior. Sentius Gemellus. Berytus. Date probably
249.</p>

<p>xiii. 7441. Germania Superior. Flavius Antiochanus. Caesarea. Date 191
or 211.</p>

<p>I.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R. i. 10. Raetia. T. Porcius Porcianus. Massilia. 3rd century.</p>

<p>iii. 1193. Dacia. C.&nbsp;Julius Corinthianus. Theveste. <em>circa</em> 200.</p>

<p>C.&nbsp;I. Gr. 3497. Dacia. T. Claudius Alfenus. Asia. <em>circa</em> 200-210.</p>

<p>These men cannot fairly be called barbarians. Massilia of course speaks
for itself, but in Theveste, Thysdrus, and Lambaesis Roman culture
was no new thing at the beginning of the third century. The same may
be said of Caesarea, if the capital of Mauretania be meant. Berytus,
too, was a colony famous for its Roman character, and Asia was not a
province notorious for its barbarism. The increased oriental element,
which is certainly noticeable among the auxilia of this period,
although not to the same extent as in other branches of the service, is
a more significant fact. But however undesirable one may consider the
influence of oriental religions and ideals to have been, the conflict
cannot be called one between civilization and barbarism. The real
matter at issue is the wisdom of the imperial government in utilizing
the material which the spread of culture and prosperity provided, and
substituting for the old hegemony of Italy a governing class drawn from
all parts of the Empire. It is true that this policy was a failure, and
that the Empire organized on this basis did not succeed in erecting
defences strong enough to resist the external pressure brought to
bear upon them in the third and fourth centuries. But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span> it was a
failure it was not necessarily a mistake.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> It is more than doubtful
whether a narrower policy which rigidly maintained the supremacy of the
Italians and denied to the majority of the provincials all share in the
administration would have been more successful: it is certain that,
had the progress of civilization lacked the stimulus which the hope
of political power supplied, the after-effects of the Roman Empire in
Europe would have been less.</p>

previous residence in the province. It is thus borne by the Cohors II
Hispanorum scutata and the Cohors I Lusitanorum. Arrian, however, had

regiment of Campanians, since a soldier gives Suessa as his birthplace

I Campanorum is identical with the Pannonian Cohors I Campestris is
misleading. On no Pannonian inscription does the title occur otherwise

supported Civilis were dismissed, and that the Cohorts I and II
Batavorum, which we meet on second-century inscriptions, were new
creations. The Alae Petriana and Sebosiana and two cohorts of
Tungrians, which had formed part of the Rhine army in 69, appear later
in Britain. But they had left the Rhine to take part in the civil war
in Italy, and were not guilty of complicity in the mutiny.</p></div>

the Rhine to the Danube between 70 and 107 the list of auxilia does
not alter so much as might be expected. Still the transference of some

Hispanorum were sent to Moesia Inferior between 74 and 82 and remained
there. Cf. D. xi, xiv, and ciii.</p></div>

D(omitiana) Brit(annica) M(iliaria) c(ivium) R(omanorum) describes
himself as a <em>civis Sequanus</em> (iii. 15197). Now the title D(omitiana)
shows that the inscription must have been erected between 81 and 96,
and Draccus, who had served 22 years, was enrolled, therefore, between
60 and 74. But his regiment, which formed part of the Vitellian army in
69 (Tac. <cite>Hist.</cite> iii. 41), must have been in Germany or Britain before
that date. Probably it was sent in 70 to Germania Inferior, won its
title, like other regiments of that province, for loyalty at the time
of the rebellion of Saturninus in 89, and was transferred to Pannonia
shortly afterwards.</p></div>

<span class="small">THE USE OF THE AUXILIA FOR WAR AND FRONTIER DEFENCE</span></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A history</span> of the art of war under the Roman Empire has not yet been
written, for the simple reason that we do not possess an account by a
good military historian of a single campaign between that of Thapsus
(46 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>) and that of Argentorate (357). Josephus does
indeed give a first-hand account of the Jewish war of 66-70, and took
some trouble over military details, but his subject limited him to
siege operations and street-fighting. The most valuable section in
his work is a general sketch of the Roman army and its organization,
and a description of the arrangement of troops on the march.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a>
Tacitus, on the other hand, who is forced by his subject to describe
several campaigns, and remains in consequence our chief authority,
cared nothing for the technical side of warfare, and does nothing more
than record, as a rule correctly enough, details which he found in his
sources.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>With strategy we need not concern ourselves, since the subject lies
beyond the scope of this essay; but tactics require more consideration
on account of the special position assigned to the auxilia in battle
formation. From the scanty information given by our authorities it
appears that in any regular engagement fought during the first two
centuries the legionary infantry were still considered to be the chief
arm and employed to deal the decisive blow.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> They occupied the
centre of the line, and the light troops and cavalry&mdash;that is to say,
the auxilia&mdash;were expected to do little more than protect them from a
flank attack. This formation was employed at Idistaviso in 16,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a>
against Tacfarinas in 18,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> against Tiridates in 58,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> against
Boudicca in 61,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> and at the second battle of Bedriacum in 69.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>
It is also prescribed by Arrian in his ‘Order of Battle against the
Alani’.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> The only considerable exception is the battle of Issos
in 193, in which the legions on both sides formed the first line and
were supported by the archers, who shot over their heads. Dio, however,
expressly states that this formation was adopted because these armies
were fighting in a narrow space with the sea on one side and mountains
on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> so that there was no need to detach a force to protect
their flanks.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<p>There were, however, cases, particularly in warfare against barbarians,
where the enemy would not meet the imperial forces in the open field,
but took up a defensive position on ground where legionaries could not
be employed with success. In these circumstances the auxilia formed the
first line and began the attack, and only if they were driven back and
pursued by the enemy did the legions come into action. The battle of
Mons Graupius, in 84, was conducted on these lines,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> and similar
tactics seem often to have been employed by Trajan in Dacia.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> In
general, however, the auxilia play a very secondary r&ocirc;le; we do not
hear either of the cavalry being used to strike the decisive blow after
the manner of Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> or of any such combination of archers and
heavy infantry as we find in mediaeval warfare.</p>

<p>The subject, however, is still obscure, and it is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> satisfactory
to turn to the part played by the auxilia in frontier defence,
concerning which the archaeological research of the past twenty years
has established more certain conclusions. In the frontier policy of
the first two centuries we can trace two opposing tendencies at work,
each of which is reflected in the disposition of the troops and the
duties required of them. At the death of Augustus the Empire had as
yet reached hardly any of its natural boundaries, although by means of
the system of client kingdoms and ‘protected’ tribes it was asserting
its claims and intentions in much the same fashion as the powers of
modern Europe are doing in Africa to-day. The first century therefore
witnessed on almost every frontier a period of expansion of greater
or less duration, in which the sphere of direct administration was
gradually pushed forward until some physical or political obstacle
was reached which necessitated either a halt or a forward policy on
a much larger scale. Throughout this period military operations were
always imminent; in Britain, for example, between 50 and 85, the
garrison marched out almost every spring, either for a campaign or a
military demonstration. In winter, therefore, or in times of peace, the
frontier armies were so disposed as to be able to take the offensive
at a few days’ notice. The legions often lay in pairs, while many of
the auxiliary regiments, instead of being scattered over a wide area,
as was the case later, were concentrated at a few strategic points.
The extent to which this system was adopted varied, of course, with
local conditions, and a few regiments always occupied more isolated
positions, but as a whole the auxilia of a province were far more
easily mobilized than later when each regiment had its own <em>castellum</em>.
On the Rhine frontier Haltern and Hofheim furnish examples of these
large <em>hiberna</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> dating from the beginning and the middle of the first
century respectively,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> and we find the same system continued for
the defence of the Taunus district annexed by Domitian.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> There is,
indeed, here a chain of forts on the frontier, but they are of small
size, with an average area of only 1&frac12; acres. The bulk of the auxilia
lay some way behind the frontier, in forts which held some two or three
regiments apiece.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> In Britain we have traces of a similar system
at the same date. The ‘Agricolan’ fort at Barr Hill is a frontier
post which would require some two centuries at most for its defence,
while the early fort at Newstead, which was probably occupied from
about 80 to 100 or later, could accommodate at least 1500 men.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>
The essentially temporary nature of such <em>hiberna</em> is emphasized by
the character of their defences, which usually consist simply of an
earth wall or palisade, little more elaborate in construction than the
<em>vallum</em> which an army in the field was expected to throw up round its
camp after a day’s march.</p>

<p>In provinces whence archaeological evidence is not forthcoming,
inscriptions indicate the same system. From Spain, for instance, we
have an early inscription referring to an officer who held command over
four cohorts,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> a similar brigade of three cohorts appears at
Syene in Egypt in the reign of Trajan.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> On the Danube frontier von
Domaszewski has concluded from the epigraphical evidence that Aquincum
and Arrabona each held two alae in the first century.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>This period of expansion may be considered to end with Trajan’s
annexation of Dacia and his failure a few years later to execute a
similar forward move on the Eastern frontier. With the accession
of Hadrian a new policy begins, which advertised by the elaborate
character of its defensive measures that the imperial government was
firmly determined to renounce all further schemes of aggression, a
determination which was adhered to until the power of decision lay no
longer in Roman hands. The outward signs of this new spirit were the
abandonment of the old <em>hiberna</em>, and the removal of their garrisons
to stone forts of a new type, each arranged to hold no more than a
single unit, which were placed at more or less regular intervals along
the frontier instead of behind it.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> The auxilia, that is, were
transformed from a potential field army into a frontier police.</p>

<p>This policy of passive defence depended, of course, for its success
upon the extent to which the frontier could be made defensible.
Fortunately by this date it lay for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span> greater part of its length
along positions of great natural strength. The Rhine, Danube,
and Euphrates, when guarded by a continuous line of forts and
watch-towers,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> and patrolled by flotillas of guard-boats, formed
a serious military obstacle to a raiding force, an obstacle even more
dangerous to its retreat than its advance. The desert frontiers of
Africa and Arabia were more easily defended, since the routes by which
a hostile force could advance were limited in number and the defence
could concentrate upon them, and the same of course holds true of the
southern frontier of Egypt.</p>

<p>There were, however, districts where such natural obstacles did not
exist, as in the case of the trans-Rhenane territory, which was divided
between Germania Superior and Raetia, and the northern frontier of
Britain, and here Hadrian had recourse to the expedient of erecting
artificial barriers, which he hoped would serve the same purpose.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>
In the former case the frontier was defended by a palisade and ditch,
which were later supplemented by an earth mound in the German section
and replaced by a stone wall in Raetia.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> On the British frontier,
between the Tyne and Solway, the existing remains are those of a stone
wall, although there are also traces of a wall of turf, which may have
been an earlier work.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> A turf wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> also defended the more advanced
line between the Firths of Clyde and Forth, which was occupied between
140 and 180.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> The southern line in Britain in its most perfect form
was guarded by a stone wall seventy-three miles long. This wall was
between six and nine feet thick, and probably stood originally about
twelve feet high. In front of it, except where the precipitous nature
of the ground rendered such an additional defence unnecessary, ran
a wide ∨-shaped ditch. At intervals of about every Roman mile stood
a stone block-house, and between every block-house two towers. The
mile-castles contained barrack accommodation for about fifty men, and
reveal abundant traces of continuous occupation.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> The garrison of
about eleven thousand men lay in stone forts of the ‘cohort’ size, the
majority of which are actually on the line of the wall, although a few,
which probably belonged originally to an earlier system of defence,
are a short distance behind it. The average interval between the forts
is some six miles, so that it was easily possible for each regiment
to man the adjacent towers and mile-castles and retain a considerable
force at head-quarters. In addition to the troops actually stationed on
the line of the wall, there were other regiments in outpost forts to
the north and in the forts which guarded the three roads leading south
to the legionary fortresses of Chester and York. The ends of the line
were also guarded against flank attacks from the sea by forts at South
Shields and on the Cumberland coast. If, then, we include all troops
within three days’ march of the wall, the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> force available for
its defence probably exceeded twenty thousand men. Taking also into
our calculations the natural strength of the position, we may safely
say that this was the strongest and best guarded of all the frontier
barriers.</p>

<p>The trans-Rhenane frontier, which extends for over three hundred miles
from Rheinbrohl on the Rhine to Eining on the Danube, was defended by
the same methods, although in certain sections the forts were more
widely separated and the garrison was proportionately weaker. There
were also fewer troops within call immediately behind the frontier
line. Here also, between the cohort forts, stone ‘Zwischenkastelle’ and
‘Wachtt&uuml;rme’ furnished additional safeguards.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>This whole system of frontier defence has been much criticized, and
the limitations and possibilities of these artificial barriers must
be carefully determined.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> To take the negative side first, they
could not, of course, be defended against unexpected attack, like the
walls of a town, unless the assailants were only a small raiding party
numbering some twenty or thirty men. On the other hand, in spite of
the parallel of the ‘Customs Hedge’ in India,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> it seems unlikely
that fiscal considerations played any large part in determining the
government on their construction. They doubtless acted, when built, as
a check on smuggling, but the expense of their maintenance would have
been quite out of proportion to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> value of the trade done with the
German or British tribes.</p>

<p>The first purpose which they served was to furnish a screen behind
which patrols could march in comparative safety, both by day and
night, and keep the whole line under constant surveillance. Thus the
passing of a hostile force could be instantly reported by messenger
or signal<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> to the nearest <em>castella</em>, whence detachments could at
once start in pursuit. Secondly, whereas the defenders nearly always
had a mounted force close at hand drawn either from the <em>alae</em> or the
numerous <em>cohortes equitatae</em>, the raiders would probably be unmounted,
since their start would be lost if they delayed to fill up the ditch
and make a gap in the barrier large enough for their horses.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
This barrier, too, had to be crossed again in retreat, and presented
a very serious obstacle to a force encumbered with booty. Indeed, the
defenders might reserve the great part of their forces for this moment,
as is recommended by Byzantine military writers describing similar
conditions.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>This sketch of the methods of defence employed applies more
particularly to the German and Raetian frontiers. In Britain, more
particularly on the southern line, it is probable that a more serious
defence was intended. In the first place, the massive stone wall, on
which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> defenders could stand, was obviously stronger than anything
on the trans-Rhenane section.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> Secondly, we have noted that the
garrison was stronger than in Germany, and could be more easily
reinforced. Moreover, even after the final abandonment of Scotland,
forts were still held in front of the southern line. Netherby on the
Esk, and Habitancium (Risingham) and Bremenium (High Rochester) on
Dere Street, were occupied by <em>cohortes miliariae equitatae</em> well
into the third century, and at the last two forts we find a <em>numerus
exploratorum</em> attached to the regular auxilia.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> These strong
outposts would have been able to check or harass the enemy’s advance
and give warning to the garrison of the wall of any impending attack.</p>

<p>All these suppositions, however, both as regards Germany and Britain,
are based upon the assumption that a raid would be the sole subject
of the attacking force, and that it would not be too numerous to be
dealt with by the garrisons of three or four <em>castella</em>. To a more
serious invasion the resistance offered was much less effective. The
legions, it is true, still remained in reserve, but they formed the
only concentrated force at the disposal of the defending general, for
the majority of the auxilia, scattered as they were along the entire
length of the frontier, could not be quickly concentrated, and a
provincial garrison can rarely have taken the field at anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> like
its full strength. The system also created serious difficulties when
it became necessary to send troops from one province to the aid of
another. Three regiments, for example, could not easily be sent from
Germany to Pannonia, because each of them constituted an essential link
in the chain of frontier defence. It became the practice, therefore,
to form out of detachments drawn from several regiments a composite
<em>vexillatio</em> in which efficiency must have been greatly diminished
by lack of <em>esprit de corps</em>. A cavalry <em>vexillatio</em> of this type
commanded by a certain Lollianus, probably during the Parthian war of
Trajan, was drawn from no less than five <em>alae</em> and fourteen <em>cohortes
equitatae</em>.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p>In defence of the system it would probably have been urged that on
every frontier the hostile forces were equally dispersed and far less
easily concentrated, and that a combination of the Celtic or Teutonic
tribes would be heard of long before it was ready for action. The
existence of the league which attacked and for a time broke through
the Danube frontier in the reign of Marcus was certainly known to the
imperial government, and the local governors succeeded in delaying the
crisis until the return of the <em>vexillationes</em> which had been sent to
the eastern frontier, with whose aid they hoped to be able to cope with
the situation.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> Their calculations were upset by the havoc wrought
in the army by the plague which these troops brought with them. Even
so the danger was eventually surmounted, and the frontiers were on the
whole successfully maintained for nearly a century more.</p>

<p>But the full consequences of this system cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> perceived without
some consideration of the changes which it brought about in the
conditions of military life and their effect upon the general morale
and condition of the troops. A very important point to notice is their
immobility. Already in the first century there was, except for the
officers, no regular system of transfers, and only an important change
in the military situation caused troops to be sent from one province
to another. In fact such changes were frequent, and considerable
transfers took place, particularly during the Flavian period and the
wars of Trajan. From the accession of Hadrian onwards, however, such
movements cease almost entirely. During the following hundred and
twenty years hardly a legion changed its position and the auxiliary
regiments remained almost equally stationary.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> We can trace
regiments which remained literally for centuries in the same province
and for the greater part of the time were in the same <em>castellum</em>. Of
the twenty-one cohorts and alae which are mentioned by the <cite>Notitia
Dignitatum</cite> as forming part of the garrison of Britain, fifteen are
shown by the evidence of diplomata to have been in the province long
before the end of the reign of Hadrian; and two more, which occur in
a diploma of 146, are probably only not mentioned earlier because
they were creations of that emperor and had consequently no veterans
ready for discharge until after his death.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> Similarly the Cohors
V Lucensium et Callaecorum was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> Pannonia at least from 60 to 198,
the Cohors I Hemesenorum from 138/46 to 240, and the Ala III Augusta
Thracum from 148 to 268/71.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> The best instance, however, is that
of the Cohors II Ituraeorum Felix. This regiment is placed by the
<cite>Notitia</cite> in Egypt, and other evidence shows it to have been in the
province in 147, 136, 98, 83, and probably 39.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> As this section of
the <cite>Notitia</cite> seems to date, at the earliest, from the beginning of the
fifth century the regiment was probably quartered in the same province
for at least three hundred and twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p>

<p>Evidence of continued stay in one <em>castellum</em> is naturally more
difficult to find, but the way in which the names Ulpius, Aelius,
and Aurelius follow one another on a series of inscriptions of the
Ala I Ulpia Contariorum from Arrabona in Pannonia Superior suggests
that the regiment remained there throughout the second century, and
the title Antoniniana shows that it had not moved before the reign of
Severus Antoninus.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> At the fort of Veczel in Dacia the Cohors II
Flavia Commagenorum has left inscriptions dating from the reigns of
Hadrian, Marcus, Septimius Severus, Severus Alexander, and Philip,
which cover practically the whole period during which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> province
was in existence.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> In Britain a remarkable series of dedications
from Amboglanna (Birdoswald), which has already been referred to, shows
that the Cohors I Aelia Dacorum was stationed there from about 211 to
271.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></p>

<p>Had the practice of employing a secondary title derived from the name
of the reigning emperor commenced before the third century it would
probably be easy to prove stays of much longer duration. The figures
given above must certainly be taken as a minimum. A second-century
auxiliary could thus make himself at home in his quarters in the
practical certainty that, with the exception of a few temporary
absences as member of a <em>vexillatio</em>, he would spend the whole of his
twenty-five years of service patrolling the frontier on each side of
his <em>castellum</em>.</p>

<p>In considering the life which the frontier guards would lead under
these conditions we must remember that the character of the auxiliary
soldier in the second century had changed considerably since the force
was first organized by Augustus. In the early first century enrolment
in the Roman service had little effect on the levies of wild tribesmen
who composed the greater part of the auxilia at this period. They might
be organized in Roman fashion, but the military qualities which they
displayed and their whole manner of fighting were inherited from their
ancestors. <em>Promptam ad pericula nec minus cantuum et armorum tumultu
trucem</em> is Tacitus’s description of a cohort of Sugambri employed in
Thrace in the reign of Tiberius, and in like fashion the German cohorts
of Caecina’s army shouted their war-songs and rattled their shields
beneath the walls of Cremona.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> the second century all this was
changed: the progress of Romanization had raised the majority of the
provincials, even in the frontier districts, to a level of culture
which placed them far above their ancestors of three generations
back, although they might still seem barbarous to a cultured Greek
or Italian.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> In the conditions of the service there was nothing
to prevent the auxilia from participating in this general advance,
and the soldiers who spent the best years of their lives in these
little frontier stations gathered around them all the amenities of
provincial life which would have been found in any country town in the
neighbourhood. On the sheltered side of the fort a civil settlement,
technically known as the <em>canabae</em>, quickly sprang up, and soon
contained as many inhabitants as the fort itself, if not more. It was
here that the soldiers placed their wives and children, that retired
veterans settled near their old comrades, and traders erected their
shops. A bath-house or two and a few small shrines, particularly those
dedicated to the popular military cults of Mithras, ‘the Unconquered
Comrade,’ and Juppiter Dolichenus satisfied the highest material and
spiritual needs.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p>At the fort of the Saalburg, where such a settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> has been
carefully explored, an area of something like seventy-five acres was
covered with buildings and gardens. Shrines dedicated to the Mater Deum
and to Silvanus and Diana have been found, as well as those of Mithras
and Juppiter Dolichenus, and two others remain as yet unidentified. On
the outskirts, here as elsewhere, lay the cemetery with its inscribed
sepulchral monuments, the chief source of our information on so many
points of military life.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> On the British wall no <em>canabae</em> have
been so carefully explored as those on the German limes, which is
the more to be regretted since the buildings are usually in a better
state of preservation; but it is still possible to see near the fort
at Borcovicium (Housesteads) the terraces on which a scanty crop was
raised, while the remains of buildings extend down the hill from the
fort at the top to a small Mithraeum in the valley.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> At Cilurnum
an elaborate bath-house was erected for the use of the soldiers of the
Ala II Asturum on the banks of the Tyne, and further excavation would
doubtless show that it did not stand alone. Where excavations have not
taken place the existence of these and other buildings is testified
to by inscriptions. At a fort on the Lower Rhine we even find the
<em>praefectus</em> repairing at his own cost the regimental clock.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>The married quarters mentioned above require a few words of
explanation. Numerous critics of the Roman army have assumed not only
that celibacy is a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> military ideal, but that it was actually
attained until Severus issued his famous edict permitting soldiers
to marry while still on active service.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> Previous to this it is
assumed that they had no relations with women but those of the least
binding description. Seeck, indeed, has carefully explained that the
‘children of the camp’ could not have been reckoned upon as a valuable
source for recruits, because the rate of mortality is notoriously
higher among illegitimate than legitimate children.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> This theory
is sufficiently refuted by the fact that, as we have seen, nearly
fifty per cent. of the recruits for the Legio III Augusta in Africa
were giving <em>castris</em> as their birthplace long before the reign of
Severus.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> A recently discovered edict of Domitian has shown
further that such unions were sufficiently permanent to be officially
recognized by the government during a soldier’s period of service,
although only legalized at his discharge.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> The effect of Severus’s
edict was merely to anticipate this act and give legal sanction to
existing and perfectly well understood social conditions. Practically
the change was probably of small importance, since it seems fairly
clear that married quarters were not allowed inside the fort walls
after this edict any more than before it, nor were married men allowed
to remain permanently outside. Cagnat has shown that the arrangement of
the internal buildings of the legionary fortress at Lambaesis, which
are proved by epigraphical evidence to have been still existing in the
third century, is entirely opposed to such a supposition, and to the
general theory, which has often been advanced, that from the time of
Severus onwards such a fortress became merely a club-house and exercise
ground for the greater part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span> troops.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> These arguments are
concerned only with the legionaries, but they are worth introducing
because the erroneous views here discussed have often been made to
apply to the army as a whole. In the case of the auxilia, indeed,
there was never any justification for their acceptance. The evidence
of the diplomata was always sufficient to show that even in the first
century the auxiliary soldiers, like the legionaries, formed family
ties during their period of service which were officially recognized
on their discharge.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> The same picture is given by early sepulchral
inscriptions, of which the following, from the Pannonian fort of
Teutoburgium, may serve as an example:</p>

<p>This tendency towards matrimony was naturally intensified by the
more settled life of the second-century auxiliary. The systematic
investigation of the cemetery attached to one of these permanent
garrisons reveals as orderly a family life as could be found in
any country town of the peaceful inland provinces. The following
inscriptions, which are drawn from different parts of the Empire, are
but few among many which might be advanced to support this contention.</p>

<p>These examples alone show how far from reality are Seeck’s licentious
mercenaries and their neglected bastards. In fact the suggestion of
many critics that celibacy is a valuable military ideal, which was
attained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> at any rate partially, until the relaxation of discipline by
Septimius Severus, proceeds upon false lines. In a short service army,
like those of modern European states, in which the whole time of the
men is necessarily occupied in learning their military duties, such
an ideal is practical enough. In the Roman Empire the adoption of a
professional army with a service of twenty-five years put it beyond the
power of any government to enforce such monastic conditions, and the
facts of the situation were, as we have seen, never misunderstood by
the imperial authorities.</p>

<p>This is, of course, far from saying that the resulting state of things
was all that could be desired. The long service system is, on this
account, open to serious objections in principle, and these objections
are intensified when we consider the lines on which this system
developed. The second-century auxiliary, encouraged by the settled
conditions of his service to form matrimonial ties, with his wife and
children comfortably settled just outside the fort walls, is perhaps
a more satisfactory spectacle from the moral than the military point
of view. Military service in the same regiment had not yet become
actually hereditary, because the enfranchised son of the auxiliary was
advanced a step in the social scale and enabled to take service in
the legions. When, however, in 212 the Constitutio Antoniniana swept
away a distinction which had long ceased to have any real basis in a
difference of race or culture, this obstacle was removed.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> Two
sepulchral inscriptions of the Cohors I Hemesenorum, so often referred
to, illustrate this change. The first is erected to a veteran of this
cohort and to two sons and a grandson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> who had taken service in the
neighbouring legions I and II Adiutrix, while in the second we find the
son of a veteran from the latter legion who has taken service in the
auxiliary cohort.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>It has already been noticed that the system of frontier defence
organized by Hadrian made it difficult either to concentrate rapidly
the garrison of a province at one point, or to send reinforcements
from one province to another. The more settled the auxiliary regiments
became, and the more local ties they formed, the more difficult did
it become to order any dislocation of troops on a large scale.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
In fact when Severus Alexander granted to the frontier garrisons any
adjoining territory which had been captured from the enemy, insisting
at the same time that their heirs could only inherit it on condition
of military service, this act was the natural culmination of a long
process of development which had transformed what had once been the
finest field army in the world into a rural militia.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> Unfortunately
just as this development was completed and the result stamped with the
seal of official approval, the emperors of the third century found
themselves faced by new military dangers of a type with which the old
system was least fitted to cope.</p>

of military operations an important feature of his work, although he
was quite lacking in military knowledge (Polybius, xii. 25); Tacitus
never pretends to concern himself with more than the moral and social
aspects of war. The same attitude may be observed both in Dio and
Herodian (ii. 15, 6). This attitude was perfectly justifiable, since
there existed, as we learn from this passage in Herodian and from
Lucian (<cite>De Hist. Conscrib.</cite>), a technical literature which would
probably satisfy our needs. That we do not possess it is the fault, not
of Tacitus and Dio, but of the Middle Ages.</p></div>

against a Highland army by the Duke of Cumberland at the battle of

British frontier range in area from 2&frac12; to 5&frac12; acres, the largest
(Amboglanna) being designed to hold a <em>cohors miliaria peditata</em>. The
German forts seem to have been on a rather larger scale, and ran up
to 15 acres, which is the area allowed at Aalen to an <em>ala miliaria</em>.
It is not meant, of course, that forts of this type did not exist in
the first century, but it was not until the reign of Hadrian that the
dispersion of the auxilia in separate units was adopted as a general
policy.</p></div>

<span class="small">ARMS AND ARMOUR</span></h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief sources of information are the sculptured reliefs on the
sepulchral monuments of the soldiers themselves and on the columns of
Trajan and Marcus. Excavations have also yielded specimens, very badly
damaged in most cases, of the weapons and armour in use at different
periods. The literary authorities contain little that is valuable, with
the exception of Arrian’s description of cavalry uniform and equipment
in his own day.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>On sepulchral monuments of cavalry soldiers dating from the first
century<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> the deceased is usually represented on horseback in
the act of spearing a fallen enemy. It may be assumed, therefore,
that the armour and weapons represented are those actually used in
warfare, in other words that these men are in ‘service uniform’.
At this period the cavalry uniform consisted of a tunic, breeches
reaching a little below the knee, both probably of leather, and
the <em>caligae</em> or military boots. Over the tunic was worn a leather
breastplate with extra shoulder-pieces to guard against a down cut.
Metal breastplates however, although rare, are not unknown. Scale
armour is worn by a trooper of the Ala Longiniana represented on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> an
early Rhenish relief,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> and also appears on two African reliefs of
early date representing equites of the Cohors VI Dalmatarum.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> The
shield is usually an oblong with the longer sides slightly curved,
but occasionally an angle in these longer sides transforms it into an
elongated hexagon. This shield was borrowed from the Celtic or Teutonic
tribes, as is shown by its frequent appearance on the reliefs in the
hands of the fallen barbarian. To judge from these reliefs it measured
about one foot by three, and was probably of wood covered with leather.</p>

<p>The helmet, which was of metal, had a projection behind to cover the
neck in the manner of the English cavalry helmet of the seventeenth
century. It was also furnished with an extra band of metal or a peak in
front to protect the forehead and large cheek-pieces which clasped over
the chin. On the monument of a trooper of the Ala Noricorum,<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> a
very good example of this class, the cheek-pieces are highly ornamented
and the top of the helmet is ridged to represent hair. The crest does
not appear, probably because it was not worn on active service.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a>
It is equally absent from the battle-scenes of the Trajan column,
although the ring to which it was fastened is shown. Some fine plumes
are, however, represented on the helmet of a standard-bearer of the Ala
Petriana on a British relief, which probably dates from the end of the
first century.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>The long broadsword or <em>spatha</em>, the characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> weapon of the
auxiliaries,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> which was probably, like the shield, of Celtic
origin,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> was worn on the right side suspended from the left
shoulder by a sword belt (<em>balteus</em>). The hilt ended in a large
knob-shaped pommel, and the sheath was often highly ornamented.</p>

<p>The lance with which the soldier strikes his prostrate adversary
appears to have had a shaft about six feet long and a broad head. Two
more spears often appear on these sepulchral reliefs in the hands of
an attendant in the background. These are probably the throwing spears
which were carried, according to Josephus,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> in a quiver on the
back, and could not therefore, owing to the position of the rider,
be represented in their proper place. Concerning the horses one can
say little except that they can hardly have been so small as they are
represented. The saddle has a high pommel and cantle and is sometimes
covered with a fringed cloth, and the junctures of the harness are
ornamented with metal plates (<em>phalerae</em>). Like all ancient cavalry the
auxiliaries rode without stirrups.</p>

<p>From these reliefs, therefore, we can construct a fairly complete
picture of the auxiliary cavalryman of the pre-Flavian period. His
equipment as he appears on the column of Trajan is essentially the
same, except that he now wears a shirt of chain-mail over his tunic
instead of the leather breastplate, and that his shield has changed
from an oblong to a narrow oval.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> It is hardly necessary now
to defend the accuracy of the column in matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> detail, but it
may be mentioned that there is further testimony for each of these
changes.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>Chain-mail appears on the Adam Klissi reliefs and is mentioned by
Arrian,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> and the oval shield is shown on a Rhenish relief dating
from the end of the first century.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> The varied scenes represented
on the column enable one also to notice further points, such as the
manner in which the shield is slung at the side of the saddle when
troops are on the march,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and the use of the military cloak
(<em>sagum</em>) which hung down the back and could not therefore appear on
the sepulchral reliefs.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>In addition to this service uniform there was, as Arrian’s description
shows, a sort of parade uniform in which the mail shirts were replaced
by brightly coloured tunics, and lighter shields and spears were
carried than those used in war.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> It was with this uniform and on
ceremonial occasions that some of the soldiers wore those curious
helmets with a mask decorating the face of which several specimens have
been found.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> The fine scale armour which has been found at Newstead
and elsewhere probably also formed part of this parade uniform. It is,
indeed, always worn by the Praetorians on the Marcus column,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span> but the
auxilia still appear in chain-mail as on the column of Trajan.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>
Specially elaborate suits of this armour were, however, worn by the
regiments of catafractarii who appear in the army list in the second
century.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> The last change which we can trace was the alteration of
the shape of the shield from oval to round, which probably took place
in the third century. An <em>eques</em> of the Cohors I Thracum is represented
on a Danubian sepulchral monument with a shield of this form,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> and
the contemporary reliefs on the arch of Constantine show that it was
practically universal a century later.</p>

<p>The equipment described above was worn by the majority of the auxiliary
cavalry, but it was by no means universal. The horse archers, if one
may judge by a soldier of the Ala I Augusta Ituraeorum represented on
a Danubian relief, carried no shield, and possibly no body armour, and
wore a leather cap in place of a helmet.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> Arrian also mentions that
some regiments carried a specially heavy spear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοντός</span>), and
devoted themselves to shock tactics.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> The <em>numeri</em>, too, did not
adopt the Roman uniform, but kept to their own dress and weapons. The
Moors of Lusius Quietus are represented on the column wearing nothing
but a short tunic; their weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> consist of a spear and a small round
buckler (<em>cetra</em>), and they ride their horses without saddle or bridle,
guiding them simply by a halter round the neck.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> The regiments
of Sarmatae enrolled by Marcus also presumably wore their national
costume, which is perhaps represented in a fragmentary relief in the
Chester Museum.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>The equipment of the auxiliary infantry in the first century is more
difficult to determine. Not only did the soldiers of the cohorts erect
fewer sculptured monuments than the cavalry troopers, but on these
reliefs the deceased is not represented in the act of fighting, so
that we cannot be certain that he appears in full service uniform. One
of the best of the early monuments is the tombstone of a soldier of
Cohors IV Dalmatarum from the Rhine.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> The deceased is dressed in
a short tunic, which is looped up at the sides so as to hang down in
front in a series of folds. The <em>sagum</em> covers his shoulders and hangs
down his back. A long <em>spatha</em> and a short dagger are suspended from
two waist-belts (<em>cingula</em>) at his right and left side respectively.
He has no body armour except a kind of sporran composed of strips of
metal which extends from the middle of his belt to the bottom of his
tunic. His legs are bare, and he wears no helmet. In his right hand he
holds two long spears and in his left an oblong rectangular shield,
which is not curved like the legionary <em>scutum</em> but flat as a board.
On two other reliefs a soldier of the Cohors I Pannoniorum<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> and an
archer of the Cohors I Sagittariorum<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> are represented in a similar
costume, except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> the Pannonian wears the <em>paenula</em> instead of the
<em>sagum</em>, and that the archer carries a bow and arrows in place of the
shield and spears.</p>

<p>If these soldiers are fully equipped they have surprisingly little
defensive armour, but on other monuments, notably those of a private
of the Cohors II Raetorum,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> and a standard-bearer of the Cohors V
Asturum,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> a leather breastplate appears similar to that worn by
the cavalry at this period. On the Trajan column too, the auxiliary
infantry are furnished like the cavalry with metal helmet and
chain-mail shirt and wear the short tunic and <em>bracae</em>.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Professor
von Domaszewski would like to see in all this a development of the
auxiliaries from light into heavy infantry,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> and it is true that in
his account of the German campaigns in the reign of Tiberius, Tacitus
emphasizes their character as light-armed troops.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> But even on the
Trajan column they are still lighter armed than the legionaries, and
the evidence of the monuments is far from decisive. The tombstones
of legionaries of the same period represent them wearing a leather
breastplate, although there is no reason to suppose that the so-called
<em>lorica segmentata</em> was not yet in use. On the whole it seems safer
to fall back on the hypothesis that on some of these monuments the
deceased is represented in a parade uniform with which, as in the case
of that described by Arrian, the breastplate was not worn. The tunic
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> its elaborate folds may also form part of this costume, since
we know from the cavalry reliefs that the short leather tunics and
<em>bracae</em> were already in use.</p>

<p>The Trajanic reliefs show several varieties of uniforms in addition to
the ordinary type described above. The flying column which the emperor
leads down the Danube includes men who wear, instead of the ordinary
helmet, an animal’s skin arranged over the head and shoulders in the
manner usually confined to standard-bearers, and others whose helmets
are of a curious Teutonic pattern.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> These may belong to regular
cohorts which had been allowed to retain something of their national
costume, but a barbarian who appears in this scene and elsewhere clad
only in long loose breeches and a <em>sagum</em>, and whose chief weapon is
a knotted club, must represent a <em>numerus</em>. Others of these irregular
regiments are probably represented by the archers clad in long tunics
and pointed caps or wearing helmet and shirt of scale armour who appear
in one or two scenes.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> They are certainly to be distinguished from
the archers of the <em>cohortes sagittariorum</em>, who appear in a uniform
which only differs from that of the ordinary auxiliary infantry in
the absence of the shield.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> The most exceptional uniform is that
of the slingers, who are dressed simply in tunics with no armour
but a shield.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> Cichorius<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> wishes to recognize in them men
from the Balearic Islands, but although the Baleares were employed
by the Republic we have no inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span> of a Cohors Balearum under
the Empire. Moreover, if there existed cohorts of slingers with this
distinctive uniform we should expect to find <em>cohortes funditorum</em>
or <em>libritorum</em> on the analogy of the <em>cohortes sagittariorum</em>. It
appears, on the contrary, from a passage in Hadrian’s speech to the
African army that slinging formed part of the general training of
all the auxilia.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> Like the cavalry, the auxiliary infantry are
represented on the Marcus column in a uniform essentially the same as
that worn eighty years previously, and no further developments can be
traced. The most striking fact which emerges from this inquiry is the
general uniformity of the equipment of nine-tenths of the auxiliary
regiments in the second century. We learn from casual references in
Tacitus that this uniformity had always been the ideal of the Roman War
Office,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> and from the military point of view there was doubtless
much to recommend it.</p>

<p>It has, however, more significance if we regard it as one phase in that
extension of a uniform material culture through at any rate the western
half of the Empire which marks the first and second centuries.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION<br />

<span class="small">THE BREAK-UP OF THE AUGUSTAN SYSTEM</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding pages we have traced the history of the auxilia
through the two centuries which followed the death of Augustus. At
the end of this period, as at the beginning, the distinction between
legions and auxilia still appears as one of the fundamental principles
of the military system of the Empire. But during it the growth of
certain tendencies, operative not only in the army but through the
Empire as a whole, had profoundly altered the original scheme by which
levies of uncivilized provincials, drawn from every province, were
to support the contingents of the ruling race. Before a century had
elapsed the legionaries were no longer Italians nor the auxiliaries
barbarians. As a result, among other things, of the steady extension
of civic rights, the legionaries were drawn from the provinces, and
as a peaceful civilization developed, the recruiting-area for legions
and auxilia alike gradually contracted to the frontier districts.
Finally, at the close of the period, the distinction between <em>civis</em>
and <em>peregrinus</em> was swept away by the legislation of 212.</p>

<p>From the military point of view also the character of the army had
undergone a no less fundamental change. The concentrated striking
force of the days of Augustus, which was ready to plunge year after
year into the heart of Germany, had been transformed into a frontier
guard, scattered over a wide front and accustomed to act permanently
on the defensive, every unit of which was fixed immovably, generation
after generation, in the same position. This system, exposed, it is
only fair to say, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> a strain far more severe than its designers had
ever contemplated, broke down completely during the course of the
third century, and although, after fifty years of anarchy, the Empire
rid itself temporarily of internal and external enemies, the military
organization was never restored on the old lines. It is our business in
this concluding section to trace the stages in this collapse, and to
suggest reasons for the change in military policy traceable in the work
of Diocletian and his successors.</p>

<p>It has already been noted that the frontier system adopted in the
second century had obvious defects.</p>

<p>It can easily be seen that if the strongly guarded frontier line were
broken through at any point the internal provinces were exposed to the
greatest danger. In themselves they possessed no means of making a
stand against an invader. Their garrisons were small, cut down in fact
to the minimum quantity required for police duty, and the provincial
militia, which we hear of during the first century, seems no longer
to have existed except in Mauretania. In fact, now that the army was
recruited almost entirely in the frontier provinces, the profession
of arms must have been more unfamiliar to the inhabitants of Western
Europe and Asia Minor than it has ever been since, and many a citizen
of the prosperous little towns of Gaul, Africa, or the Hellenized
districts of the East can never have set eyes on the imperial uniform.
The situation was clearly a dangerous one, and the lesson of the
Marcomannian War must have made it clear that this system could only
continue if the frontier troops were supported by a strong and mobile
striking force, ready to move at a moment’s notice to any threatened
point.</p>

<p>In the second century the only available regiments not occupied in
frontier defence or police duty consisted of the Household Troops at
Rome, i.e. the ten Praetorian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> cohorts and the Equites Singulares.
The Guards were in fact employed by Domitian, Trajan, and Marcus on
the Danube frontier, but their numbers were small, their duties were
not calculated to increase their military efficiency, and they were
rightly looked down upon by the trained veterans of the frontiers.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a>
The gravity of the situation was grasped by Septimius Severus, who
took advantage of the discredit in which the Praetorians were involved
by their support of Didius Julianus to disband the old cohorts, which
had been recruited in Italy and the ‘civilized’ provinces of Noricum,
Macedonia, and Spain, and replace them by a <em>corps d’&eacute;lite</em> selected
from the legions.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></p>

<p>This force, still too small to be effective, was further strengthened
by an increase in the number of the Equites Singulares,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> and
the addition of one of Severus’s new legions, the Secunda Parthica,
which was henceforth stationed at Alba.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> His successors continued
the same policy: under Severus Alexander we find an officer of the
Household Troops bearing the title <em>praepositus equitum itemque peditum
iuniorum Maurorum</em>,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> a title which implies the existence of at
least two regiments of this character, and the <em>Osroeni sagittarii</em>,
who were among this emperor’s following at the time of his murder, were
so numerous that they attempted to set up a rival to Maximin and were
temporarily disbanded.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>Had the construction of a field army on these lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span> proceeded in
time of peace, it would necessarily have involved a reorganization of
the whole system to meet the increase in expenditure. As it was, the
fifty years of civil war and barbarian invasion which followed the
accession of Maximin saw the old order irreparably ruined. The great
Illyrian emperors who saved civilization for another century, and
spent themselves in marching ceaselessly from province to province,
cutting down the hydra heads of revolt and striving to repel the
recurring assaults of Goth or Persian, could neither hope to maintain
the old frontier lines nor spare time to collect vexillations after
the second-century manner when each new danger threatened. Sweeping
together Household Troops and fragments of the broken frontier armies
and enlisting thousands of barbarian mercenaries, they strove to keep
a concentrated force at their disposal which they moved constantly
backwards and forwards across the Empire as each internal or external
crisis demanded. It was this field army which shared in the imperial
triumphs and received such rewards as the exhausted finances could
bestow. In comparison with it such units of the old frontier troops,
legions and auxilia alike, as maintained their old positions (and we
shall see that many did so) sank steadily in prestige and importance.
When finally the barbarian fury had temporarily spent its force, and
a cessation of internal warfare granted Diocletian and Constantine
breathing space in which to reorganize the civil and military
administration of the Empire, the provisional reconstruction brought
into being by these fifty years of stress and disaster was formally
recognized and incorporated in the new order. The distinction between
first and second class troops is no longer between legions and auxilia
as in the days of Augustus, but between the Palatini and Comitatenses
on the one hand, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span> followed in war the emperor himself and the new
heads of the military hierarchy, the <em>magistri peditum</em> and <em>equitum</em>,
and were kept concentrated at strategic points within the Empire in
time of peace, and on the other the Limitanei or Ripenses, who formed,
under the <em>duces limitum</em>, a territorial frontier guard, membership in
which was now hereditary in law as well as practice.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p>At this point we might legitimately take leave of our subject, for
although the names of many of the old auxiliary regiments still appear
in the fourth and fifth centuries among the Limitanei, there is nothing
in either character or status to distinguish them from such of the old
legions as had survived in a similar capacity. The title ‘auxilia’, on
the other hand, is now applied to corps of new creation and barbarian
origin which figure on the roll of the field army.</p>

<p>But the very fact that so many of the old corps still figure on the
army list tempts us to consider the circumstances under which they
survived and to take a brief survey of the changed conditions under
which they continued their existence. It is fortunate that for the
history of the Roman army during the fourth century we possess two
authorities of considerable merit, the historian Ammianus Marcellinus
and the <cite>Notitia Dignitatum</cite>. Ammianus, himself a soldier, is
practically the first historian of the Empire since Josephus to give
us a first-hand account of military operations.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> The <cite>Notitia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Dignitatum</cite> purports to give us, what we do not possess for any
earlier period, a complete list of the regiments composing the imperial
army. It is true that this list appears to be a compilation drawing
from evidence of very different dates, but there can be no doubt that
it represents for most provinces the general state of things prevailing
in the fourth century.</p>

<p>The most significant fact which strikes us in these authorities is the
barbaric character of both troops and officers. The majority of the
officers mentioned by Ammianus, even those of highest rank, are of
Teutonic origin, many being drawn even from the Franks, who are usually
reckoned among the more uncivilized of the Empire’s assailants. The
same picture is presented by the <cite>Notitia</cite>. Corps which must at any
rate have been originally raised from barbarian tribes, who normally
dwelt beyond the frontier, abound among the Palatini and Comitatenses,
and are to be found in smaller number among the Limitanei. Thus
barbarian Atecotti from Caledonia figure as <em>auxilia palatina</em> in
the field armies of Illyricum, Italy, and Gaul;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> cavalry drawn
from the Alani appear as a <em>vexillatio palatina</em> in Italy,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> and
Marcomanni as a <em>vexillatio comitatensis</em> among the troops assigned
to the <em>comes Africae</em>.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> Among the troops of the second class we
find in the garrison of Egypt Vandals, Iuthungi, and Quadi from the
Danube, Franks and Chamavi from the Lower Rhine, Tzanni and Abasgi from
the Caucasus,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> and much the same elements appear in the garrison
of Phoenicia.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> In regard to these troops it may be urged that,
since they are organized in cohorts and alae after the old model, they
seem to have been incorporated at latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span> towards the end of the third
century, and that such corps, since they can hardly have obtained fresh
drafts from their original recruiting-grounds, may have undergone the
same transformation as the regiments of Spaniards and Gauls which were
sent to Egypt and Syria in the first century. In the case in question
this argument may possibly hold good,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> but in other parts of the
Empire it was no longer necessary to send recruiting agents beyond
the borders to find barbarian troops. In recording the presence of a
<em>praefectus Sarmatarum gentilium</em> in almost every considerable town in
North Italy,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> and of similar officers commanding German <em>laeti</em>
in all the provinces of Gaul, the <cite>Notitia</cite><a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> is but confirming
the abundant evidence of other authorities as to the settlement of
barbarians within the Empire during the third and fourth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></p>

<p>This wholesale use of barbarians was largely due to the hasty
constructive measures which the stress of the third-century invasions
demanded. The normal recruiting-grounds of the army were the first to
be desolated, and after a costly campaign it was easier to fill the
depleted ranks by enlisting barbarian prisoners than to raise and train
levies from the unwarlike provinces of the interior. In the same way it
seemed statesmanlike to settle other prisoners on the deserted fields,
who, secure themselves in their tenure, might aid in repelling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
successors. Thus the number of barbarian contingents was constantly
increasing, and behind the banners of Aurelian or Probus the Teutonic
war-band marched side by side with regiments which could claim a
record extending back to the reign of Augustus. The only considerable
levies made within the Empire after 250 were carried out in the
Illyrian provinces of which most of the emperors were natives, and are
represented by the fifty or sixty regiments of Dalmatian cavalry which
appear in the <cite>Notitia</cite> stationed in almost every province.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>But side by side with the new creations, such as the Felices Honoriani
and the Comites Taifali, the names of many of the old corps still
figure on the fourth-century army list. The legions had naturally come
off best; the most determined barbarian raid seldom took a legionary
fortress, and if it did, a detachment serving with the field army would
probably survive to keep the name of the corps in existence. It is
not surprising, therefore, to find that of the thirty legions which
existed before the reign of Severus, twenty-seven still appear in the
<cite>Notitia</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> From the way in which they are mentioned, however,
we can gather many evidences of the storm through which the army had
passed. Many detachments, severed from the main body on some special
service, were never able to regain it, and are found where the fortunes
of war had stranded them. Thus Legio VII Gemina not only appears in
its proper place, divided between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span> field army and the territorial
forces of Spain, but is also mentioned as a <em>Legio Comitatensis</em> in
the field army of the East, and a <em>Legio Pseudo-comitatensis</em> in
Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> The old Dacian legion, XIII Gemina, is represented by
several detachments guarding that part of the Danube which was allotted
to the new province of Dacia Ripensis, but appears also in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a>
Legio II Italica, which had guarded Noricum since the days of Marcus,
is included also as a <em>Legio Comitatensis</em> in the field army of
Africa.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p>The auxiliary regiments naturally did not fare so well. The small
detachments drafted off for service in the field army probably
soon lost their identity, and the <em>castella</em>, which contained the
regimental head-quarters, must have often been taken and destroyed.
Still, as the appendix shows, over fifty regiments survived long
enough to be included in the <cite>Notitia</cite>. Naturally the chances of
surviving had varied on different frontiers. The section of the
<cite>Notitia</cite> which deals with the northern frontier of Britain contains
so many names of pre-Diocletianic regiments that it has sometimes
been thought to represent the earliest stratum in the whole work.
There seems, however, no reason to doubt that the original garrison,
although in attenuated numbers, succeeded in maintaining itself
until well into the fourth century. We know from archaeological
evidence that even the mile-castles were not abandoned until the
reign of Constantine.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span> almost equally large proportion of
old regiments is present in the garrison of Cappadocia, which had
been spared the full force of the Persian attack.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> In Egypt, too,
most of the old regiments still survive, although they are largely
outnumbered by recent formations.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> The garrison of this important
corn-producing province, more essential than ever since the foundation
of Constantinople, had evidently been increased to guard against
renewed attacks from the Blemmyes on the Upper Nile, who had raided it
successfully in the third century. The Rhine frontier, on the other
hand, seems to have been swept of its old garrison from end to end. Two
of its legions have disappeared, and the other two, which are included
in the field army, probably only survive thanks to their names being
preserved by detachments which were absent when the fortresses were
stormed.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> It is not until we reach Raetia and the protection of the
Upper Danube that any of the old auxiliary regiments appear. On the
Middle and Lower Danube, however, the scene of repeated invasions and
civil wars during the third century, few of the old troops survived.
The struggle was probably a long one: we know from epigraphical
evidence that several forts were still holding out towards the end
of the century, and excavation may show that many barbarian raids
retired without doing any serious damage. But the attack was constantly
renewed, and it is not surprising to find that three new cavalry
formations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> have replaced the Cohors Hemesenorum at Intercisa,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a>
and that detachments of Equites Dalmatae are now responsible for
practically the whole stretch of frontier between Belgrade and
Buda-Pesth.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Only the Cohors I Thracum C.&nbsp;R. and the Cohors III
Alpinorum, the latter of the old Dalmatian army, remain to remind us
of the corps which defended this frontier in the second century.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a>
On the Lower Danube, where the Goths had crossed in force, and in the
oriental provinces which had felt the heavy hand of Persian invader and
Palmyrene usurper, we are only greeted by similar survivals.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> The
section dealing with Cyrenaica is lost, so that we know as little of
its garrison now as in the previous period. In Africa the frontier had
been reorganized in a number of small districts, each under an officer
styled <em>praepositus limitis</em>, and although we have a list of these
districts, we are not told by what troops they were guarded.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> Only
for Tingitana are we given a slightly fuller schedule in which a few
old names appear.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p>The isolation of these remnants of the old imperial army among the
flood of Teutonic and other barbarian immigrants shows that the new
r&eacute;gime inaugurated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span> Diocletian was foredoomed to failure. The Empire
had trusted to a professional army recruited from a comparatively small
section of its inhabitants, and when this army succumbed to the strain
of civil war and foreign invasion, and the old recruiting-grounds were
wasted, few of the provinces of the interior, which for nearly two
centuries had practically ceased to furnish soldiers, held any reserve
of military material. By admitting this and calling upon the barbarian
to occupy and defend the wasted frontier lands, the civilization of
the ancient world showed that it had lost the vitality which might
have assimilated these new elements as Gaul, Spaniard, and African
had been assimilated in the past. A succession of able rulers and the
overpowering prestige of the past kept the framework intact for a
century after Diocletian’s death. Then when the final catastrophe came,
and the Western provinces sank into the Dark Ages, a national revival
headed by the still virile races of Asia Minor saved the once despised
provinces of the East from being involved in a common ruin. It is with
Zeno the Isaurian, not with Diocletian, that the true renascence of the
Empire begins.</p>

<p>But the auxiliary regiments which survived into the fourth century
need not only suggest to us, by the smallness of their numbers and
their isolation among their barbarian comrades, the nearness of the
end. The reflection that many of these regiments had held the position
assigned to them and preserved a continuous military record for over
three hundred years may serve also to remind us of the greatness
of the services rendered by the army of the Empire to the cause of
civilization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the course of this essay an attempt was made to estimate
roughly the total number of auxiliary troops in existence during
the first century, but the evidence for this period was too scanty
to permit of discussing further the size and composition of the
various provincial garrisons.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> In the second century, however,
the evidence of ‘diplomata’ and dated inscriptions becomes relatively
copious, and it has seemed possible to draw up something like an ‘army
list’, giving the names of the regiments stationed in every province
during this period so far as they are known. Such a list cannot, of
course, make any pretensions to completeness, but it is hoped that
the main conclusions which it suggests will not be found incorrect,
and that it may be of service to future workers in the same field.
The period to which the list is intended to apply extends from the
death of Trajan, in 117, to the accession of Marcus, in 161, during
which no hostilities on a large scale took place, so that in view of
the general character of the military system we may safely assume
that few regiments were transferred from one province to another. In
drawing up the list the following principles have been observed. In
the first place, all regiments have been included which are assigned
to a particular province by a ‘diploma’ or inscription dated within
the limits of the period. Secondly, those regiments are included which
can be shown to have existed before and after the period, since they
must obviously also have been in existence during it, although their
allocation to a particular province is of course not so certain. To
this category belong those regiments which, while only mentioned in
later inscriptions or the <cite>Notitia Dignitatum</cite>, bear evidence in the
titles ‘Claudia’, ‘Flavia’, ‘Ulpia’, or ‘Aelia’ that they were created
at an earlier date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>These canons have not, however, been rigidly adhered to in every case.
In estimating the garrison of Mauretania Caesariensis; for example,
where evidence is particularly scanty, it seemed foolish to exclude
that afforded by the diploma of 107, the only one yet found in the
province. In this and other doubtful cases a summary of the evidence
used is appended to the name of the regiment, so that the reader
may judge of its value for himself. When the facts seem certain the
epigraphical evidence is not cited in full, although to illustrate
certain arguments used in the text a reference is given to every
‘diploma’ in which each regiment is mentioned and also to the <cite>Notitia
Dignitatum</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> In calculating the strength of the various provincial
garrisons the cohorts and alae are reckoned at 500 or 1,000 men each,
the mounted infantry of a <em>cohors equitata</em> being estimated at 25 per

<p>These calculations show that during the period in question the
auxiliary troops amounted to 47,500 cavalry, 15,375 mounted infantry,
and 129,925 infantry, giving a total establishment of 191,800 men. It
is probable, however, that this puts the proportion of mounted men
too low. Arrian’s <em>Ectaxis</em> shows that nearly every cohort of the
Cappadocian garrison was <em>equitata</em>, and although the proportion of
mounted men was doubtless higher on the eastern frontier than on the
Rhine or in Britain, it is probable that if we possessed more documents
similar to the <em>Ectaxis</em> dealing with the other garrisons we should
find a higher proportion of <em>cohortes equitatae</em> than our present
evidence suggests. It is equally probable that the total figure arrived
at falls below the reality. For no province is it likely that the list
is complete; in some cases, such as Mauretania Tingitana and Africa,
the garrison is obviously put far below its real establishment, while
for Arabia and Cyrenaica we have no evidence at all. The deficiency is
certainly too great to be made good by the few regiments of uncertain
habitation which conclude the list. Probably we may reckon on a total
figure of about 220,000 men, of whom at least 80,000 would be mounted.
The twenty-eight legions in existence at this time, if we follow
Suetonius in assigning 5,600 men to a legion,<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> would only have a
total establishment of 156,800, so that clearly in dealing with the
army at this period we must disregard Tacitus’s statement that the
auxilia were approximately equal in number to the legionaries.</p>

<p>The total military establishment of the Empire at the accession
of Marcus including the Household Troops, that is to say the ten
Praetorian and six Urban<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> cohorts and the Equites Singulares, and
the complement of the fleets in the Mediterranean and the Channel and
on the Rhine, Danube, and Euphrates, must thus have amounted to some
420,000 men. This total, however, was to be still further increased
before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> the decline began. At the beginning of the third century when
additions had been made to the Household Troops, when the legions had
been increased to thirty-three<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> and scores of <em>numeri</em> added to the
frontier guards, there may have been nearly half a million men serving
with the colours, a larger disciplined force than was at the disposal
of any one state before the nineteenth century, and the largest
professional army which the world has ever seen.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_489_489" id="Footnote_489_489"></a><a href="#FNanchor_489_489"><span class="label">489</span></a> The second inscription mentions a Spanish cohort in
Cappadocia, which is probably identical with the Cohors II Hispanorum
E. commanded by the <em>praefectus</em> mentioned in the third, whose career
seems to have lain entirely in the Eastern provinces. He would have
commanded it about 120.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_490_490" id="Footnote_490_490"></a><a href="#FNanchor_490_490"><span class="label">490</span></a> Mentions the regiment as stationed in Syria, whither it

however, merely a conjecture to identify it with the regiment stationed
later in Lycia-Pamphylia.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_493_493" id="Footnote_493_493"></a><a href="#FNanchor_493_493"><span class="label">493</span></a> Of the nineteen regiments mentioned (taking ‘Augusta
Syriaca’ as the title of one ala, not two), eight are mentioned on the
Syrian diploma of 157, two on the Palestine diplomata of 86 and 139,
and one on the Egyptian diploma of 83. Of the remainder two have left
inscriptions in the East, two seem to have come from the Danube, and
only four are otherwise unknown.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_494_494" id="Footnote_494_494"></a><a href="#FNanchor_494_494"><span class="label">494</span></a> Should probably be <em>equestris</em>, the regiment belonging
to the same series as the Cohors VI Equestris which formed part of
the garrison of Bithynia when Pliny was governor. Cf. Pliny, <cite>Ep.</cite> x.
106. The meaning of the title is obscure, unless <em>equestris</em> simply =
<em>equitata</em>.</p></div>

Sugambrorum V.&nbsp;E. from the Cohors I Claudia Sugambrorum. The first is
probably identical with the regiment mentioned by Tacitus as being in
Moesia in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 26 (Tac. <cite>Ann.</cite> iv. 47), the second a later
creation distinguished as such by its secondary title.</p></div>

whose service lay almost entirely in the Eastern provinces. On this
ground and because Cohorts I and II of this series were certainly in
the East the regiment has been assigned to Syria. This second argument
applies to Cohort IV. Both regiments were in any case in existence at
this period.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_499_499" id="Footnote_499_499"></a><a href="#FNanchor_499_499"><span class="label">499</span></a> Or is this a cohort converted into an ala with the
increase of cavalry in the fourth century? In this case it may be

<p><a name="Footnote_500_500" id="Footnote_500_500"></a><a href="#FNanchor_500_500"><span class="label">500</span></a> Curiously enough the regiment appears in the Syrian

<p><a name="Footnote_501_501" id="Footnote_501_501"></a><a href="#FNanchor_501_501"><span class="label">501</span></a> Cagnat, however, considers that the regiment was in the
province as early as 150, relying on viii. 3917, p. 955.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> appendix is mainly designed to supplement the table on <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>,
by giving a list of the auxiliary regiments grouped according to the
provinces in which they were raised. I have also added for the sake
of completeness a further section dealing with the <em>cohortes civium
Romanorum</em>, and a few regiments of which we do not know the place of
origin. The list thus contains, or is intended to contain, the names
of all the auxiliary regiments known to us, and includes far more than
existed at any one time. The greater part of this list is, of course,
merely a repetition of that drawn up by Cichorius in his articles on
<em>ala</em> and <em>cohors</em> contributed to Pauly-Wissowa, and in view of the
admirable summary of the evidence there given I have restricted myself
to appending to the title of each regiment the name of the province
in which it was stationed, or, when this is unknown, a reference to
a single inscription mentioning it. Only in cases where I have been
able to add to the list a regiment unknown when Cichorius wrote have I
added a note on the evidence. The whole may, in fact, be described as
a summary of Cichorius’s articles, with a supplement bringing them up
to date, and as such may, I hope, be of some value to students of this
subject.</p>

<p>As in the list on p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, regiments raised before 70 and those of later
date are divided into two groups, distinguished by the letters A and B.</p>

<p>The character of these regiments has already been discussed on pp.
65-7, where the origin of the greater number, at any rate, was traced

in <em>cohortes voluntariorum</em>. The latter form a series numbered up to
thirty-two, which may have included the <em>cohortes ingenuorum</em>. The
latter may, however, have been numbered separately, and it must be
admitted that the presence of a Cohors IV Voluntariorum is rather

<p>This last section completes our survey of the auxiliary forces of the
Empire so far as they are known to us, and it is some satisfaction to
feel that so far as the mere names of the regiments go our knowledge is
now approaching completion. The recently discovered diploma for Moesia
Superior (<cite>A. E.</cite> 1912. 128), which gave the names of twenty-four
regiments which were stationed in the province in 103, did not mention
one previously unknown to us, and a glance at the <cite>Ann&eacute;e &Eacute;pigraphique</cite>
for the past ten years will show how rarely a fresh name appears among
the numerous inscriptions dealing with the auxilia. This knowledge
does not, of course, carry us very far; while so many regiments are
merely known to us by name from one or two casual inscriptions, we can
tell neither the total number of auxilia maintained at any one time
nor the relative strength of the frontier garrisons, and a host of
minor problems are even further from solution. The very fact, however,
that new evidence is now so slow to accumulate seemed to justify the
attempt to utilize the available material and state summarily such
conclusions as are at present attainable on a subject of some interest
and importance to all students of the Roman Empire.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
